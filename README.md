Java-gnome with Webkit
=========================

**For WebkitGTK2**

This is a form of java-gonme [http://java-gnome.sourceforge.net] from release 4.1.3. This fork adds a support for webkitgtk2 package. It's not fancy, but it does work if your requirements are simple - like simply showing a webpage.

It has support for DOM access if you manage to get JVM loaded in your extension. For further details see webkit.md from directory java-gnome-4.1.3-Webkitgtk2
