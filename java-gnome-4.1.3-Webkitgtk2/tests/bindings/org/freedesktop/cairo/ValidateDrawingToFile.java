/**
 * Started life as the Cairo drawing example; evolved to a unit test. This
 * TestCase is predicated on the assumption that PNGs are deterministic. I
 * don't know of anything that actually guarantees or requires this to be the
 * case, but it seems a reasonable guess, given that it is ultimately just a
 * pixel mapping. Perhaps compression will get in the way; if so, switch this
 * to a TIFF.

 * As you will see, the file being compared was (can be) generated with this
 * code, so if you need to redo this run it as an executable.
