 * This is not the greatest API. The fact that you have to populate the window
 * field in a subclass is ok, but the presence of the helper methods here just
 * seems clutter. What really complicates matters is trying to find a scheme
 * where running the Snapshot with a minimal main() method causes the Window
 * to appear, whereas running the Harness also works sensibly. Ideally this
 * would be like JUnit test cases, but that would require a plugin to Eclipse
 * to work. There is, therefore, something to be said for doing this as a
 * JUnit TestSuite.
