 * One of the main hypothesis in the design of the new java-gnome 4.0 bindings
 * is that enums in C are sequential from 0, and that the #defined constants
 * in the various GLib and GTK header files are enums and hence sequential.
 *
 * This little file tests that assumption. If you compile and run this, you
 * will hopefully see a nice sequence, starting at 0!

 *    gcc `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-2.0` -o enums enums.c
