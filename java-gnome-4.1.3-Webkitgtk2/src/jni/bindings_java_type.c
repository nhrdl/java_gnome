 * Create a GBoxed type to hold Java references. The actual "structure" being
 * boxed is just a gpointer. When the GBoxed is free'd, the reference will be
 * dropped, all neat and tidy.
 *
 * Using a pointer as a GBoxed is somewhat of a sharp shortcut, but it is
 * viable: GBoxeds are treated as pointers by the g_value_*() functions, and
 * since we control the meaning of the _copy() and _free() functions it's all
 * under control. Beware, however, the problem that arose in using the pointer
 * value in the getter case; see the native implementation of
 * GtkTreeModelOverride.gtk_tree_model_get_reference() for further details.
