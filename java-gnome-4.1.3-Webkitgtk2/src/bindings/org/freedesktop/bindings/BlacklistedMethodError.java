/**
 * Thrown by a generated method which is actually (dangerously) incomplete due
 * to the fact that information about one or more native types was lacking
 * when the bindings were generated. This Error is made visible as a last
 * ditch programatic measure to draw attention to the fact that this method
 * cannot be called; hopefully the {@link FIXME} in the method signature would
 * catch your attention first. This represents a wonderful opportunity for you
 * to contribtue to the java-gnome bindings.
 * 
 * <p>
 * hackers: don't even <b>think</b> about exposing a method that throws this
 * in java-gnome's public API.
