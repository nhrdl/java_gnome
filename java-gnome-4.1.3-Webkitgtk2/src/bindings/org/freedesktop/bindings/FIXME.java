/**
 * A type for which we had no data at bindings generation time! In order to
 * fix this, you will need to either
 * <ol>
 * <li>Add an appropriate (define...) block to define the type in a new .defs
 * file
 * <li>Add a hardcoded type in Thing's <code>static {}</code> block (probably
 * a FundamentalThing), or
 * <li>worst case, you will have to improve the architecture of java-gnome as
 * a whole to deal with the situation represented by this parameter or return
 * type.
 * </ol>
 * This is marked as a public type, but clearly this is an artifact of the
 * code generation process and is not for developer consumption.
