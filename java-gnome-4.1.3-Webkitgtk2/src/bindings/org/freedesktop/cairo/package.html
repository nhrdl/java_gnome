The Cairo Graphics library is the high performance drawing suite used to do
custom drawing in GTK. The heart of the library is the <a
href="Context.html">Context</a> class which is what you use to draw on a
Surface; look there for information, and for an example of how to get started
with Widget drawing, see <a
href="../../../../examples/cairo/ExampleDrawingGradient.html"><code>ExampleDrawingGradient.java</code></a>.
