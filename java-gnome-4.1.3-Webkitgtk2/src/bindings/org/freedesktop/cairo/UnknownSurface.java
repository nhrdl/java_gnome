/*
 * In java-gnome if we offer accurate fully derived types, and normally it is
 * an error if we can't do so (ie, we haven't coverage for something yet).
 * Cairo has a number of cases where internal types are exposed (notably
 * MetaSurface for vector backends) for which there is no public
 * identification. An instance of this class is created in such cases. Be
 * warned that getting one of these is NOT a workaround for failing to create
 * a proper Proxy subclass for something that IS public.
