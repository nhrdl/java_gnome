/**
 * A linear gradient.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Before using the LinearPattern you need to call
 * {@link Pattern#addColorStopRGBA(double, double, double, double, double)
 * addColorStopRGBA()} a few times to set up the gradient. For example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * pat = new LinearPattern(40, 25, 120, 100);
 * pat.addColorStopRGB(0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.8);
 * pat.addColorStopRGB(1.0, 0.0, 0.8, 0.3);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * and then you can get on with using the Pattern in drawing operations.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * cr.setSource(pat);
 * </pre>
