/**
 * A radial gradient Pattern.
 * 
 * <p>
 * After calling this and before using the RadialPattern you need to call
 * {@link Pattern#addColorStopRGBA(double, double, double, double, double)
 * addColorStopRGBA()} a few times to set up the gradient. For example, to
 * create an circular alpha blend:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * pattern = new RadialPattern(75, 75, 25, 75, 75, 120);
 * pattern.addColorStopRGBA(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
 * pattern.addColorStopRGBA(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * and then you can get on with using the Pattern in drawing operations:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * cr.mask(pattern);
 * </pre>
