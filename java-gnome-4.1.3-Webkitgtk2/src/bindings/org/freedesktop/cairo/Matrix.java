/**
 * A matrix describing an affine transformation.
 * 
 * <p>
 * You can apply this transformation to a Cairo Context with its
 * {@link Context#transform(Matrix) transform()} method as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * matrix = new Matrix();
 * matrix.rotate(...);    // and/or
 * matrix.scale(...);     // and/or
 * matrix.translate(...); 
 * 
 * cr.transform(matrix);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Calls to the <code>rotate()</code>, <code>scale()</code>, and
 * <code>translate</code> methods are cumulative on a given Matrix.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Applying a transformation is what take you from <var>device
 * co-ordinates</var> to <var>user-space co-ordinates</var>; you are in fact
 * always working in the later but we tend not to focus on this as the default
 * is naturally no transformation.
 * 
 * <h2>Examples</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In each of the illustrations below, we draw a box as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * cr.setSource(0.7, 0.8, 0.8);
 * cr.rectangle(5, 5, 25, 15);
 * cr.stroke();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * We then apply the transform shown, change colour to blue, and then draw the
 * exact same rectangle again:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * cr.setSource(0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
 * cr.rectangle(5, 5, 25, 15);
 * cr.stroke();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Thus both the original rectangle and the result of the matrix operation are
 * shown.
