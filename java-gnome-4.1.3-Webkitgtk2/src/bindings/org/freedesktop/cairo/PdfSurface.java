 * You specify the size of a PdfSurface in points, and all subsequent

 * points, not pixels.

 * the PDF; when that is not available the PDF backend will fallback to
 * rendering bitmaps of the desired content.</i>

     * A4 paper is 210mm x 297mm, which works out as about:

     * <pre>
     * surface = new PdfSurface(&quot;output.pdf&quot;, 595.275, 841.889);
     * </pre>
     * 
     * more generally, you can use get paper size information via GTK's
     * printing support using [<code>org.gnome.gtk</code>] PaperSize's
     * {@link org.gnome.gtk.PaperSize#getWidth(org.gnome.gtk.Unit) getWidth()}
     * and {@link org.gnome.gtk.PaperSize#getHeight(org.gnome.gtk.Unit)
     * getHeight()} methods, for example:
     * 
     * <pre>
     * paper = PaperSize.getDefault();
     * width = paper.getWidth(Unit.POINTS);
