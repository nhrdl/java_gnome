/**
 * Constants specifying the compositing operating mode in effect. These are
 * set for a drawing Context using {@link Context#setOperator(Operator)
 * setOperator()}, and take effect when commands like {@link Context#paint()
 * paint()} are invoked.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The Context should be created using a cairo {@link Surface}. <i>The
 * operators don't seem to work correctly when a
 * {@link org.gnome.gdk.Drawable Drawable}</i> is used instead of a cairo
 * Surface.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The example images shown below were generated with the following code:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * cr.rectangle(0, 0, 75, 75);
 * cr.setSource(0.7, 0, 0, 0.8);
 * cr.fill();
 * 
 * cr.setOperator(Operator.FOO);
 * 
 * cr.rectangle(40, 40, 75, 75);
 * cr.setSource(0, 0, 0.9, 0.4);
 * cr.fill();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The drawing operations in cairo are said to be <b>bounded</b> and
 * <b>unbounded</b> with reguards to the Surface to be drawn to.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When an operator is said to be bounded any cairo mask present determines
 * where the operation is applied.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When an operator is said to be unbounded the operation is applied ignoring
 * any present mask. <i>Note: Clipping can still limit an unbounded
 * operator.</i>
