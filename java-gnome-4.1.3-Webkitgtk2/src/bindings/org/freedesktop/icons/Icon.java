/**
 * Named icons. These constants represent icons that should be available in
 * the current icon theme.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The named icon standard groups icons in different categories. There is a
 * subclass of Icon for each of these divisions: common {@link ActionIcon
 * action}s that can be taken by users, {@link ApplicationIcon applications},
 * main menu {@link CategoryIcon categoies}, {@link DeviceIcon devices} and
 * more importantly {@link MimeIcon MIME types}, {@link EmblemIcon emblems}
 * used to annotate other icons, the all important smiley {@link FaceIcon
 * faces}, XDG defined {@link PlaceIcon places}, and a list of common
 * {@link StateIcon states} for various application features.
 * 
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * These constants can be used to create an Image using the constructor
 * {@link org.gnome.gtk.Image#Image(Icon, org.gnome.gtk.IconSize) Image()}
 * taking an Icon:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * image = new Image(FaceIcon.FACE_SMILE);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * You can also use named icons in TreeViews; DataColumnIcon and a
 * {@link org.gnome.gtk.TreeModel#setValue(org.gnome.gtk.TreeIter, org.gnome.gtk.DataColumnIcon, Icon)
 * setValue()} taking an Icon are for specifying a named icon in a TreeModel
 * and CellRendererPixbuf has a
 * {@link org.gnome.gtk.CellRendererPixbuf#setIcon(org.gnome.gtk.DataColumnIcon)
 * setIcon()} where you can specify the column to pull the image from.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Ideally you should always get an icon back when requesting an Image with
 * one of these constants. There is a fallback mechanism if an image isn't
 * found, but that is somewhat vague and certainly up to the overall desktop
 * theme you're using. Worst case you'll get the "broken missing image" icon.
