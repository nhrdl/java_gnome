/**
 * A generic value that can be passed as a parameter to or returned from a
 * method or function on an underlying entity in the GLib library and those
 * built on it. Value is only used in setting or getting Object properties,
 * and in the TreeModel system.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>For use by bindings hackers only.</b><br>
 * As with other classes in <code>org.gnome.glib</code>, this is
 * implementation machinery and should not be needed by anyone developing
 * applications with java-gnome.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Ironically, Values are <i>not</i> actually type safe; if you happen to
 * create one to hold Strings, and then call the getEnum() method on it, your
 * program will explode (this is somewhat to the contrary of the spirit of
 * java-gnome). These are therefore only for use from within strongly typed
 * methods exposing a safe and sane public API. You've been warned.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>Complementing the object oriented system supplied by the GLib library is
 * a set of foundation elements, <code>GType</code> and <code>GValue</code>,
 * the latter being defined as "a polymorphic type that can hold values of any
 * other type", which isn't much help, really.</i>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>Since instances of Java classes are their own identity, we do not need
 * to directly represent <code>GType</code> and <code>GValue</code> as
 * separate classes. We implement <code>GType</code> as a characteristic that
 * any</i> <code>Value</code> <i>or</i> <code>Object</code> <i>has.</i>
