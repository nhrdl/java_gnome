/**
 * Base class of the object system used by GLib and libraries based on it,
 * such as GTK.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i><b>This is the wrapper around <code>GObject</code>!</b></i>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>Methods here provide the mechanism to get and set "properties" on the
 * underlying <code>GObject</code>s. As a deliberate design decision to ensure
 * type safety, however, these are not exposed for public use. To offer a
 * getter or setter for a property, a java-gnome subclass must expose an
 * explicitly named method. For example, to set the</i> <var>righteous</var>
 * <i>property, (assuming that the <code>GObject</code> in question has such a
 * property, that it is writable, and that it takes a string), create a method
 * like this:</i>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public void setRighteous(String value) {
 *     setPropertyString(&quot;righteous&quot;, value);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <i>The use of a String property name is, of course, insanely type-unsafe,
 * which is why we don't expose it in our public API. Luckily, though, in
 * general it is not necessary to use this at all, as most
 * <code>GObject</code>s provide convenience methods for such things, and
 * should be used in preference wherever available.</i>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>It is probably also worth noting that these code paths are less
 * efficient by about 8:1 as a <code>GValue</code> must be constructed as a
 * wrapper around the data for the property being set. While that's not too
 * expensive in C, from Java (and from all other language bindings of GTK) it
 * requires allocation and initialization of the wrapper structure which
 * really is just throw away.</i>
