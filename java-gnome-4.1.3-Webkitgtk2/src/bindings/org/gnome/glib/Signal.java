 * Marker interface which is the parent of all signals as expressed in the
 * bindings. Calling it Signal is actually a slight misnomer; when someone
 * implements the concrete Signal subclass that is written into the public API
 * files a "SignalHandler" is more what they've created.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Developers using the bindings will never need to use or subclass this
 * directly.</b> People wishing to write signal handler callbacks implement
 * the subclasses of this interface provided by individual Widgets. See the
 * signal called Button {@link org.gnome.gtk.Button.Clicked Button.Clicked}
 * for a thorough example of how signals are used in practise.

/*
 * This is only here so that the callback design is more straight forward.
 * Otherwise we'd have to lookup the jclass for each signal on the JNI side,
 * and that's silly. The downcast in the generated handleName() method will
 * take care of it.
