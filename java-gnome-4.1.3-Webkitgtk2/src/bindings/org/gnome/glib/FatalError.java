/**
 * Misuse of the underlying library. This is thrown as a result of a
 * programmer carrying out an operation which the native library considers
 * illegal. In an ideal world we would inhibit this before we even get to the
 * native side, but in this case we didn't, and their defence mechanisms have
 * caught the problem.
 * 
 * <p>
 * By definition, a <code>CRITICAL</code> has to be fatal; the application is
 * known to be in an undefined state after one has been emitted. While some
 * programs allow the user to carry on in blissful ignorance, these warnings
 * indicate a programmer doing something wrong, and that needs fixing.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The message has, therefore, been thrown as a Java Error. This gets you a
 * stack trace at the place where the problem occurred, and that's how we
 * identify problems in the Java world.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i><b>This is not the wrapper around <code>GError</code>!</b></i>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>This class is our way of exposing fatal error conditions in a
 * Java-appropriate fashion. <code>GError</code>, on the other hand, is GLib's
 * mechanism for returning conditions that the developer can ask the user for
 * a decision about. Incidentally, we do not expose those directly in the
 * java-gnome public API; where they occur we propagate an appropriate Java
 * checked exception instead. See {@link GlibException}</i>.
