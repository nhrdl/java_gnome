/**
 * A Container which holds a variable number of Widgets in a single vertical
 * row. All the children of this VBox are allocated the same width - that of
 * the widest Widget packed into the VBox.

 * <p>
 * A VBox is almost always the first thing (and only thing, of course) added
 * to a new Window; doing so gives you a natural mechanism to layout the
 * contents of a Window in logical sequence from Menu through to Buttons and
 * Statusbar.
 * 
 * <p>
 * All the methods you need add widgets to VBoxes and to manipulate their
 * characteristics are on parent class Box. See its
 * {@link Box#packStart(Widget) packStart()} as a good first step.
