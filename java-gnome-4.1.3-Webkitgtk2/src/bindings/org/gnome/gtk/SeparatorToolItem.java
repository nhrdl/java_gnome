 * A SeparatorToolItem usually appears as a vertical line, and is used to

 * 
 * <p>
 * Somewhat unusually, a SeparatorToolItem can be used to force align other
 * ToolItems at the right of the Toolbar by adding one with
 * {@link #setDraw(boolean) setDraw(false)} and {@link #setExpand(boolean)
 * setExpand(true)} between the two "sides".
