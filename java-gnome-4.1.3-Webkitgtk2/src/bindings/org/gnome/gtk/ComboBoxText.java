/**
 * A ComboBox for displaying simple Strings. <img src="ComboBoxText.png"
 * class="snapshot" /> A common use case for ComboBoxes is to just choose from
 * a list of textual options. This subclass of ComboBox takes care of the
 * mechanics of setting up a the ListStore and the appropriate CellRenderers
 * so as to allow a straight forward interface with a limited number of
 * convenience methods for adding Strings.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Usage is very straight forward:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * combo = new TextComboBox();
 * combo.appendText(&quot;SYD&quot;);
 * combo.appendText(&quot;YYZ&quot;);
 * combo.appendText(&quot;JFK&quot;);
 * combo.appendText(&quot;LHR&quot;);
 * ...
 * </pre>
 * 
 * You can still use the {@link ComboBox#getActive() getActive()} from
 * ComboBox, but for simple lists of Strings being displayed be this Widget,
 * the String specific {@link #getActiveText() getActiveText()} that is
 * introduced here is probably what you want.
