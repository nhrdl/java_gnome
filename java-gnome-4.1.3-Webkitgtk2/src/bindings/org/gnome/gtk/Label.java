/**
 * A Widget that displays a small amount of text.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Labels are the backbone of any Window. They are frequently used to identify
 * other controls with names, as headings in Windows, and are the building
 * blocks that Menus and Buttons are made up of. All the difficult parts about
 * rendering text are taken care of here, such as text direction, fonts. And,
 * of course, you can enable them to allow their text to be copied.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Labels can display normal text or text that has been formatted with Pango
 * markup. FIXME with a reference to our Pango guide page.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Although you can pack multiple lines into a Label, there does come a point
 * when the amount of text you're trying to show gets out of hand. At that
 * point you might want to investigate the {@link TextView TextView} Widget.
