/**
 * Widgets which allow you to select a file or directory. <img
 * src="FileChooserDialog.png" class="snapshot"> GNOME has a unified
 * FileChooser which is used by all applications to select files. It comes in
 * several pre-baked forms, notably {@link FileChooserDialog} (a Dialog which
 * can be used as a modal popup), and {@link FileChooserButton} (which is a
 * Button which displays the selected filename and pops up a FileChooserDialog
 * when activated).
 * 
 * <p>
 * Be aware that much of FileChooser's internal behaviour depends on the main
 * loop cycling; calls to methods like {@link #setCurrentFolder(String)
 * setCurrentFolder()} and {@link #setFilename(String) setFilename()} will not
 * actually take effect until you start the main loop or return from the
 * current signal handler (as the case may be).
