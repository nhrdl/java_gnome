/**
 * Add the ability for a Widget to accept events. A fair number of Widgets do
 * <i>not</i> have the ability to process events coming from the user because,
 * under ordinary circumstances, they don't need it. If you want a Label or
 * Image to take keystrokes or mouse clicks, then you instantiate an EventBox
 * and pack your Widget into it.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Quite a number of Widgets share underlying resources. That's not something
 * you normally need to worry about as a developer, but if you have called
 * {@link Widget#getWindow() getWindow()} and find yourself needing an
 * underlying [<code>org.gnome.gdk</code>] Window specifically for your
 * Widget, then use an EventBox.
 * 
 * <p>
 * EventBoxes can also be used for things like painting a different background
 * colour behind an otherwise transparent Widget.
