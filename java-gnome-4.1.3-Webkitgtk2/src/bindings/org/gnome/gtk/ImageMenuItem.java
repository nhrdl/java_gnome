/**
 * A MenuItem which displays an icon Image to the left of the Label text. This
 * is used almost exclusively to add the MenuItems with common behaviour from
 * the family of Stock icons, for example "File->Quit" and "Edit->Copy", so
 * that the icons used are consistent with the rest of the GNOME Desktop.
 * Indeed, it is somewhat discouraged to create ImageMenuItems with your own
 * icons as too many icons can distract visually from the fact that the stock
 * ones allow the eye to quickly recognize expected UI elements.
 * 
 * <p>
 * See Action's {@link Action#createMenuItem() createMenuItem()}; you
 * frequently need to do a UI activity from more than one place and Action
 * will (among other things) generate the ImageMenuItem for a given Stock
 * item. See also Button's {@link Button#setImage(Image) setImage()} for a
 * discussion of the relationship between Images and Label text.
