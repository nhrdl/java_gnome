 * A ToolButton has an image or icon and a Label. The user Toolbar preferences
 * determine whether the Label is actually shown on screen. Even if you
 * disable the Label in your desktop preferences, you should provide a valid
 * Label to your application ToolButtons, as other users will have them
 * showing and your program will look a bit silly without textual labels.
