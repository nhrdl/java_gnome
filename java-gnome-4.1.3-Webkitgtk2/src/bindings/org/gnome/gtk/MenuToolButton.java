/**
 * A MenuToolButton is an special kind of ToolButton that has an additional
 * drop-down Menu.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Next to the ToolButton itself, a MenuToolButton shows another little Button
 * with an arrow. When the user clicks this additional Button, a drop-down
 * Menu pops up.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The main usage of a MenuToolButton is to provide access to several related
 * actions in a Toolbar without wasting too much screen space. For example,
 * your application can have a MenuToolButton for the "New Document" action,
 * using the attached Menu to let users choose what kind of new document they
 * want to create.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A MenuToolButton has a default action, to be executed when user clicks the
 * main Button itself and not the the arrow Button. You can capture that
 * default event with the {@link ToolButton.Clicked} signal. User Menu
 * selections are captured with the usual {@link MenuItem.Activate} signal of
 * each <code>MenuItem</code>.
