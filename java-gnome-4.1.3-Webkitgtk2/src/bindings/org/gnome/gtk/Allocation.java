/**
 * An object with information about the size of the rectangle that has been
 * allocated to a Widget and its position within its parent Container as a
 * result of consideration of the Widget's size request. See Widget's
 * {@link Widget#setSizeRequest(int, int) setSizeRequest()} for a more
 * detailed discussion of the size request-allocation process. You get the
 * Allocation currently given to a Widget with Widget's
 * {@link Widget#getAllocation() getAllocation()}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Before the request-allocation process has occurred, you can expect this
 * class to report a size of <code>1</code>x<code>1</code> at position
 * <code>-1</code>,<code>-1</code>. You probably don't want to rely on those
 * numbers; but that's what the initial values are.
