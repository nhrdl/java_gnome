 * an empty circle (rather than an empty square) and the selected MenuItem in
 * the group us shown with a dot inside (rather than a check mark).
 * 
 * <p>
 * However, while a CheckMenuItem can be used alone to choose between two
 * states, a RadioMenuItem is used together in a group of other (related)
 * RadioMenuItems to offer a choice of one of those MenuItems. Only a single
 * MenuItem in a group can the active at any one time.
