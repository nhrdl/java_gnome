/**
 * A Dialog suitable for operations that need to select a file, such as "File
 * -> Open" or "File -> Save" commands.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A FileChooserDialog is just a Dialog with a FileChooserWidget plus
 * appropriate Buttons that corresponding to the specified
 * {@link FileChooserAction FileChooserAction}. Otherwise, all the methods
 * provided by the FileChooser interface are available which gives you the
 * necessary power to manipulate the selection received from the Dialog.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Using a FileChooserDialog to open a file could go like this:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * FileChooserDialog dialog;
 * ResponseType response;
 * 
 * // instantiate
 * dialog = new FileChooserDialog(&quot;Open File&quot;, window, FileChooserAction.OPEN);
 * 
 * // run the Dialog
 * response = dialog.run();
 * dialog.hide();
 * 
 * // deal with the result
 * if (response == ResponseType.OK) {
 *     open(dialog.getFilename());
 * }
 * </pre>
