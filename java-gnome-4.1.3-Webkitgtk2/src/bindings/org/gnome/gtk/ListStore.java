/**
 * The model storing a list of data. ListStores are the concrete TreeModel
 * subclass used as the backing data store by a TreeView displaying tabular
 * data, storing both the material to be presented as well as meta-information
 * used to fine tune the presentation of that data. ListStores are also used
 * as the backing store for the list of options in a ComboBoxes.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Detailed discussion of how to instantiate ListStores is included in the
 * {@link DataColumn} class. In summary, given
 * 
 * <pre>
 * final DataColumnString monarchName;
 * final DataColumnInteger coronatedYear;
 * final DataColumnPixbuf portrait;
 * final ListStore model;
 * ...
 * </pre>
 * 
 * you build a three column model as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * model = new ListStore(new DataColumn[] {
 *     monarchName = new DataColumnString(),
 *     coronatedYear = new DataColumnInteger(),
 *     portrait = new DataColumnPixbuf()
 * });
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Although we talk about TreeModels all the time as the base superclass, it's
 * not a good idea to declare your model as a TreeModel when instantiating
 * because you'll need {@link #appendRow() appendRow()} method which is here,
 * on the concrete type ListStore. In other words, do:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ListStore model = new ListStore(...);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * as shown above, not:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * TreeModel model = new ListStore(...);
 * </pre>
