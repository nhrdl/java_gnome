/**
 * A decorative border frame with an optional label. This is typically used to
 * surround a group of widgets with a a visual hint grouping them together.
 * 
 * <p>
 * These are frequently over-used and so using Frames is actually highly
 * discouraged: in general Widgets already have sufficient decoration and
 * adding extra horizontal and vertical lines distracts the user and actually
 * makes it <b>harder</b> to distinguish the Widgets from one another. If you
 * need to group widgets, do so with white space or use a technique like
 * applying {@link SizeGroup}s to give a set of Widgets a consistent
 * appearance.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that the "label" can be a full Widget in its own right; if you use the
 * methods which take a text string they will transparently create a Label for
 * you containing that text and using it on the edge of the Frame.
