/**
 * A Dialog preconfigured to present a cautionary message to the user and to
 * request confirmation of an action.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Be careful not to overdo it - a Dialog popping up to confirm every last
 * action is a) really annoying and worse b) will desensitize the user to the
 * message - they will just start ignoring the Dialog and thus probably miss
 * the chance to avoid something <i>really</i> important.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This is a modal MessageDialog of type {@link MessageType#WARNING WARNING}
 * with an "Ok" Button for the user to confirm they want to proceed, and a
 * "Cancel" Button for them to abort the operation.
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * final Window w;
 * final Dialog d;
 * final ResponseType result;
 * 
 * d = new WarningMessageDialog(w, &quot;You are about set off the fire alarm&quot;,
 *         &quot;Is that what you really want to do?&quot;);
 * result = d.run();
 * 
 * d.hide();
 * if (result == ResponseType.OK) {
 *     // do dangerous action
 * }
 * </pre>
