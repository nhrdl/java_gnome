/**
 * A temporary pointer to a row in a TreeModel. TreeIters are used to indicate
 * a row in a TreeModel, either the "current" row if you are iterating over
 * the data, or as an indication of which row a given event occurred on.
 * 
 * <p>
 * To obtain a new TreeIter, use one of the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>ListStore's {@link ListStore#appendRow() appendRow()} (to add a new
 * record to the end of the data set in the model);
 * <li>TreeModel's {@link TreeModel#getIterFirst() getIterFirst()} (to start
 * iterating through the rows in the model); or
 * <li>TreeSelection's {@link TreeSelection#getSelected() getSelected()}
 * (allowing you to identify the selected row and subsequently read data from
 * it, usually with TreeModel's
 * {@link TreeModel#getValue(TreeIter, DataColumnReference) getValue()}.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Like other iterators in Java, a TreeIter becomes invalid the moment the
 * underlying model changes. If you need a persistent pointer to a particular
 * row, create a {@link TreeRowReference TreeRowReference}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>Note that although one use case for TreeIter is to iterate through all
 * the rows in a model, more often they are used to point to a single row (the
 * one you are presently adding data to, or the one that was selected by the
 * user); these aren't <code>java.util.Iterator</code>s.</i>
