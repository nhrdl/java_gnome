     * every other translation layer method in java-gnome; ensuring the main
     * loop is within the GDK lock is critical to our successful thread safety
     * story. For obscure reasons relating to optimizing Eclipse's debugging
     * behaviour, for this one method ONLY we enter the monitor on the JNI
     * side.
