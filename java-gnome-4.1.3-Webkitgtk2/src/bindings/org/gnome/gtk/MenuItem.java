 * MenuItems are the basic elements that form a Menu.
 * 
 * While MenuItems are Containers and are thus capable of containing other
 * Widgets; in practise only the specialized MenuItem classes will work
 * properly as they are what support highlighting, alignment, submenus, etc.
 * 
 * <p>
 * MenuItems can be either left justified or right justified, but in general
 * you should just leave this alone and it will do the right thing for your
 * locale (left aligned for western languages, right aligned for right-to-left
 * languages like Arabic).
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>Right justification was initially designed to be used for "Help" Menus,
 * but this is now considered a bad idea and is no longer used in GNOME.</i>
