/**
 * Display the data from a {@link TreeModel} in a tabular form. TreeViews are
 * ubiquitous in most applications, being used to both output data in list
 * form, as well as allowing the user to select one or more items from a list.
 * TreeView is the view part of GTK's model-view-controller pattern list
 * Widget, with one of the TreeModel subclasses supplying the underlying data
 * model. <img src="TreeView.png" class="snapshot">
 * 
 * <p>
 * The TreeView API is very powerful, but with that power comes considerable
 * complexity. To build a working TreeModel backed TreeView you will need to
 * follow the instructions presented in the documentation quite carefully. The
 * remainder of this page discusses the presentation side of the API; see
 * {@link DataColumn DataColumn} for a detailed overview of the contents side.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A TreeView is composed of one or more vertical columns called
 * {@link TreeViewColumn TreeViewColumn}s. Into these are packed
 * {@link CellRenderer CellRenderer}s. A CellRenderer does the job of taking
 * data from the underlying TreeModel and rendering it in the TreeViewColumn.
 * There is a family of CellRenderers for different underlying data types, but
 * you'll use CellRendererText almost exclusively.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Let's assume we have a ListStore with a String DataColumn in it, ie
 * 
 * <pre>
 * final ListStore model;
 * final DataColumnString countryNameColumn;
 * final TreeView view;
 * final TreeSelection selection;
 * TreeViewColumn vertical;
 * CellRendererText text;
 * 
 * ...
 * model = new ListStore(new DataColumn[] {
 *     countryNameColumn,
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Note that there is nothing that requires you to <i>populate</i> your model
 * before building your TreeView. You can do that later - indeed, that might
 * be the whole point of your application.
 * 
 * <p>
 * You start creating your view by instantiating a TreeView and then using it
 * to get TreeViewColumn instances:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * view = new TreeView(model);
 * vertical = view.appendColumn();
 * vertical.setTitle(&quot;Country&quot;);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Now you construct a CellRenderer, specifying what TreeViewColumn it's going
 * to be a part of, and then the most important part, specifying where its
 * data is going to come from. This is the step that binds TreeView and
 * TreeModel.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * text = new CellRendererText(vertical);
 * text.setText(countryNameColumn);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * along with setting any other properties on the CellRenderer as necessary.
 * And that's it! You will of course need to do this for each TreeViewColumn
 * of information you wish to have showing in your TreeView. (We tend to find
 * it easier if you reuse the TreeViewColumn and CellRenderer variable names;
 * there is usually no real reason to keep a reference to them individually;
 * otherwise you've got to come up with unique names for everything and that
 * tends to make for ugly code).
 * 
 * <p>
 * Dealing with the events generated on the TreeView is either straight
 * forward or quite complicated, depending on what you are trying to
 * accomplish. If you just need a callback when the user activates a row in
 * the display, then the {@link TreeView.RowActivated} signal will do the
 * trick fairly simply; see its documentation for an example. For anything
 * else, you will need to use the {@link TreeSelection TreeSelection} helper
 * class (every TreeView automatically has one). It has a
 * {@link TreeSelection.Changed} signal which you hook up to which will tell
 * you what row(s) are currently selected.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * selection = view.getSelection();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The design of the TreeView API is such that you can have more than one view
 * for a given TreeModel, but we tend to only create TreeModels as the place
 * to push the text that we wish displayed, so in general you'll have one
 * TreeModel per TreeView.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>We have departed a fair way from the method call sequence used in the
 * underlying GTK library, in particular by assuming default behaviour and
 * combining calls where possible. This is in an effort to make the TreeView
 * API somewhat easier to learn, more appropriate in a Java context, and
 * easier to use for the common cases which dominate its usage.</i>

     * in the handler there, quite reasonably expecting that the row that you

     * to that signal your code will run before the default handler and the
     * <i>previously</i> selected row will still be selected while your
     * handler runs. This is annoying. It is the default
     * <code>Widget.ButtonPressEvent</code> handler which selects the new row,
     * so you have to manually select it yourself before acting on the
     * right-click. It is <code>getPathAtPos()</code> which gives you the
     * ability to do so:
     * 
     * <pre>
     * view.connect(new Widget.ButtonPressEvent() {

     *

     *         selection.selectRow(path);
     * 
     *         // and now pop your context menu, doing
     *         // something with the row as appropriate.
