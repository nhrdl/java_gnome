 * Allocates a GtkTreeIter by calling the boxed's _copy() function on a local
 * struct variable. By definition, a "boxed" is a struct. Local variables, of
 * course, all have local storage on the stack. So with the & operater you
 * can pass them to a function that takes a pointer so it can modify them; in
 * our usage we need one in pointer form so use gtk_tree_iter_copy() to get
 * us one in a manner that will be safely released by a later call to
 * gtk_tree_iter_free().
