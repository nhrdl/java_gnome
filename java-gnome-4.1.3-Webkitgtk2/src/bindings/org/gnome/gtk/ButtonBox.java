/**
 * Provide a consistent layout of Buttons throughout your application. Use an
 * {@link HButtonBox} to lay buttons out horizontally or a {@link VButtonBox}
 * to lay buttons out vertically.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Buttons are packed into a ButtonBox the same way widgets are added to any
 * other Container, using {@link Container#add(Widget) add()}. You can also
 * use Box's {@link Box#packStart(Widget) packStart()} or
 * {@link Box#packEnd(Widget) packEnd()}, but for ButtonBoxes both these
 * functions work just like <code>add()</code>, ie., they pack the button in a
 * way that depends on the current layout style and on whether the button has
 * had {@link ButtonBox#setChildSecondary(Widget, boolean)
 * setChildSecondary()} called for it.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The layout/spacing can be altered in a programmatic way in order to alter
 * the 'feel' of a program to a small degree, although in general overriding
 * the defaults used by every other application on the desktop will impact the
 * user's experience and so is not recommended. If you do need to make
 * adjustments, the arrangement and layout of the Buttons can be changed with
 * {@link #setLayout(ButtonBoxStyle) setLayout()}.

/*
 * TODO it seems that the methods to control spacing even more minutely were
 * deprecated. I'm guessing that's because they were moved up to Box or
 * Container? If so, and if we expose them, then we should add a reference to
