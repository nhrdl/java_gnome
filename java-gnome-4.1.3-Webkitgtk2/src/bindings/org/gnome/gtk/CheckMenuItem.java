/**
 * A MenuItem that maintains a binary state.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A CheckMenuItem is just like a MenuItem, but additionally it displays a
 * "check box" alongside the normal Label, indicating the state of the boolean
 * value it holds. When that value is set to <code>true</code>, the item is
 * <i>active</i> and the box shows the check mark.
 * 
 * <p>
 * You can use a CheckMenuItem as a way to allow users of your application
 * enable or disable a feature in an application. This is often used within to
 * toggle options, for example to let the user hide an optional Widget of your
 * user interface.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The active state is switched automatically when the user activates the
 * MenuItem. You can access the current state with the {@link #getActive()
 * getActive()} method. And while you can still connect to the
 * <code>MenuItem.Active</code> signal, CheckMenuItem provides the
 * {@link CheckMenuItem.Toggled} signal, emitted when the active state
 * changes.
 * 
 * <p>
 * See the {@link MenuItem parent} class for further details general to all
 * MenuItems.
