/**
 * A drop-down set of Widgets creating a menu. Menus consist of other
 * {@link MenuItem}s. Menus are either placed inside a {@link MenuBar} or
 * another MenuItem, thereby forming a sub-menu. An entire hierarchy of Menu
 * structures can thus be created by appropriately placing Menus inside
 * MenuBars or MenuItems.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A "context menu" (a stand-alone menu which pops-up) can also be created;
 * this is commonly used to create a context sensitive popup menu in response
 * to a right-click (or left-click as the case may be); see the popup()
 * method.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For a broader explanation of the Menu API see {@link MenuShell}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>GTK does have the ability to "tear" Menus off from the parent Container.
 * After consistently poor results in usability testing, however, tear-off
 * menus are now highly discouraged in the GNOME community. They are therefore
 * not presented in the java-gnome bindings.</i>
