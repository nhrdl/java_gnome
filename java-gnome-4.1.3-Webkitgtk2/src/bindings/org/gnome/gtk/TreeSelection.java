/**
 * Manipulate the selection state of a TreeView. Every TreeView has an
 * accompanying TreeSelection object which is used to manage whether or not
 * rows can be selected, and to return to the programmer the current state of
 * which rows are selected, if any.
 * 
 * <p>
 * TreeSelection can be used to programmatically select rows by either
 * TreeIter or TreePath; see the <code>selectRow()</code> methods. For
 * example, to select the first row you could do:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * final TreeSelection selection;
 * 
 * selection = view.getSelection();
 * selection.selectRow(new TreePath(&quot;0&quot;));
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Using TreeSelection to determine the currently selected row is fairly
 * straight forward:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * selection.connect(new TreeSelection.Changed() {
 *     public void onChanged(TreeSelection source) {
 *         final TreeIter row;
 * 
 *         row = selection.getSelected();
 * 
 *         if (row != null) {
 *             // do something!
 *         }
 *     }
 * });
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Unfortunately, the <code>TreeSelection.Changed</code> signal is not
 * entirely deterministic; it is sometimes emitted more than once or for no
 * change at all. You'll need to allow for this in your code.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>Mostly this is an API helper; the underlying documentation notes that
 * these could have all been methods on <code>GtkTreeView</code>.</i>
