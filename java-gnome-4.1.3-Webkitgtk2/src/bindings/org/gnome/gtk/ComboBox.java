/**
 * A Widget used to choose from a list of items. <img src="ComboBox.png"
 * class="snapshot" />
 * 
 * <p>
 * Internally, ComboBox uses a TreeModel to store the items, giving you the
 * same MVC power of GTK's TreeView/TreeModel system. There is also an
 * alternative API which can be used to create and manipulate ComboBoxes which
 * are comprised only of text. If that is your requirement, see
 * {@link TextComboBox}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * ComboBox is a CellLayout, that is, it possesses many of the same aspects as
 * a TreeViewColumn, and, along with being backed by a TreeModel, is used in
 * much the same way as a TreeView: create a ListStore or TreeStore then build
 * the GUI side by creating CellRenderers against the ComboBox.
 * 
 * <p>
 * An abbreviated example of using this follows; assuming a ListStore
 * <code>model</code> with at least DataColumnString <code>column</code> in
 * it,
 * 
 * <pre>
 * combo = new ComboBox(model);
 * renderer = new CellRendererText(combo);
 * renderer.setText(column);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * and that's it. While conceptually straight forward, it turns out to be a
 * lot of work if all you're doing is a single column of DataColumnString. But
 * the ability to <i>also</i> have a DataColumnReference in your model means
 * you can get a link back the object that is being represented by the "mere"
 * text label being displayed to the user, and this can be very powerful.
 * Likewise, you can build ComboBoxes with more complicated layouts, for
 * example having with several verticals of text and perhaps an image packed
 * into the ComboBox as well. Finally, don't forget that you can use several
 * different views against one TreeModel, so a TreeModel that is in use
 * somewhere else in your app can also be the source data for your ComboBox.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>The underlying <code>GtkComboBox</code> is actually presents two
 * different APIs that are essentially mutually exclusive, which is why we
 * have split this into two public classes.</i>
