/**
 * A multi-line text display Widget. <img class="snapshot" src="TextView.png">
 * 
 * GTK leverages the powerful text rendering capability provided by the Pango
 * library. This is used throughout the toolkit, but nowhere more so that when
 * displaying multiple lines of text in a single Widget. TextView is the view
 * part of GTK's model-view-controller pattern text display Widget, with a
 * {@link TextBuffer} supplying the underlying data model.
 * 
 * <p>
 * TextView can be used for passive display of multiple lines of text by
 * disabling the <var>editable</var> property. Usually, however, a text canvas
 * is used for entering or editing text and the TextView/TextBuffer APIs
 * combine to provide a powerful editing capability.
 * 
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * 
 * Having instantiated a TextBuffer to store and programmatically manipulate
 * the text, you create a TextView as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * TextBuffer buffer;
 * TextView view;
 * ScrolledWindow scroll;
 * ...
 * 
 * view = new TextView(buffer);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Most people want the text to wrap. This is enabled by setting a WrapMode
 * but something must act to restrain the horizontal width of the TextView
 * Widget as it will size-request as much space as would be needed to render a
 * single line. Likewise, wrapping is usually combined with scrolling, and
 * this can be set up in a fairly straight forward fashion:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * view.setWrapMode(WrapMode.WORD);
 * 
 * scroll = new ScrolledWindow();
 * scroll.setPolicy(PolicyType.NEVER, PolicyType.ALWAYS);
 * scroll.add(view);
 * ...
 * 
 * window.setDefaultSize(300, 700);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * then packing the ScrolledWindow into a parent Container hierarchy. In
 * example shown here the call to <code>setDefaultSize()</code> on the
 * toplevel would constrain the overall Window size, forcing a narrow
 * size-allocation on the TextView.
 * 
 * <p>
 * As with TextBuffer, TextIters are the mechanism used to point to locations
 * within the displayed text. There are numerous methods here on TextView
 * which manipulate the displayed view (for example
 * {@link #scrollTo(TextIter) scrollTo()}) many of which take a TextIter as an
 * indicator of position. Don't be confused that the TextIters are somehow
 * different depending on their source; they <i>always</i> refer to a position
 * in a TextBuffer but are often translated to also identify a screen position
 * in the TextView. You will often find yourself getting a TextIter from the
 * TextBuffer (perhaps in response to a <code>TextBuffer.Changed</code> or
 * <code>TextBuffer.InsertText</code> emission) and then switching over to
 * here and calling TextView methods - and then going back to TextBuffer again
 * a moment later.
 * 
 * <h2>Appearance</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@link TextTag}s are what are use to cause ranges of text within a TextView
 * to appear with various formatting (bold, italics, colour, etc) over and
 * above being displayed as normal text. You apply such tags to the TextBuffer
 * either when <code>insert()</code>ing or with <code>applyTag()</code>. See
 * TextTag for details and examples.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Incidentally, if you need to change the font of the text being rendered in
 * this TextView by default use Widget's {@link #modifyFont(FontDescription)
 * modifyFont()}, for example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * desc = new FontDescription(&quot;Monospace, 12&quot;);
 * view.modifyFont(desc);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * see FontDescription for all the gory details. As usual, we recommend that
 * you do <i>not</i> do this without good cause, instead leaving the
 * application font to be what the user has selected the system Appearance
 * Preferences font settings dialog provided by GNOME.
 * 
 * <a name="height"></a>
 * <h2>Line height calculations</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Working out the heights for each line of text in the TextView and doing
 * related positioning can, at times, be computationally intensive. So GTK
 * does this in a background idle task.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Ordinarily you don't have to worry about this, but methods like
 * {@link #getLineY(TextIter) getLineY()} will not report correct information
 * until this has happened. If you are doing drawing based on the co-ordinates
 * of a given line in the <code>TEXT</code> Window of the TextView, it is easy
 * to be trapped by this: you hook up to the <code>TextBuffer.Changed</code>
 * thinking that you can use this as an indication of when the TextView has
 * changed, but unfortunately this turns out not to be the case.
 * <code>TextBuffer.Changed</code> is indeed emitted, but the information
 * returned by <code>getLineY()</code> will not have been updated until after
 * the current signal handlers finish and the high-priority idle task can run.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Studying the internal implementation of this logic in GTK, it turns out
 * that the bulk of the work to do validation of the line height calculations
 * and text placement happens in code paths triggered off of
 * <code>Adjustment.ValueChanged</code> (which is emitted, for example, when
 * scrolling occurs). Thus there does seem to be a way to trick the TreeView
 * into getting on with the revalidation early, and that is to emit
 * <code>Adjustment.ValueChanged</code> yourself. So, given the usual
 * TextView/TextBuffer fields and an Adjustment:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ...
 * final TextView view;
 * final TextBuffer buffer;
 * final ScrolledWindow scroll;
 * final Adjustment vadj;
 * ...
 * </pre>
 * 
 * and assuming <code>view</code> has been packed into <code>scroll</code>,
 * etc, you can get the Adjustment and use <i>it</i> changing as the trigger
 * to do your redrawing logic:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * vadj = scroll.getVAdjustment();
 * vadj.connect(new Adjustment.ValueChanged() {
 *     public void onValueChanged(Adjustment source) {
 *         // now the line heights will be correct
 *         doSomethingWith(view.getLineY());
 *     }
 * });
 * </pre>
 * 
 * That works for when real scrolling happens, but if you need to precipitate
 * matters, use Adjustment's <code>emitValueChanged()</code> to fire the
 * <code>Adjustment.ValueChanged</code> signal:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * buffer.connect(new TextBuffer.Changed() {
 *     public void onChanged(TextBuffer source) {
 *         vadj.emitValueChanged();
 *     }
 * });
 * 
 * window.connect(new Window.ConfigureEvent() {
 *     public boolean onConfigureEvent(Widget source, EventConfigure event) {
 *         vadj.emitValueChanged();
 *         return false;
 *     }
 * });
 * </pre>
 * 
 * and so on.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A possible alternative to the above workaround is to iterate the main loop;
 * See {@link Gtk#mainIterationDo(boolean) Gtk.mainIterationDo()}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>Obviously "internal to GTK" implies that we are second guessing the
 * implementation details. This workaround is not based on documented public
 * behaviour, and unfortunately is not guaranteed to be stable. So as we say
 * in Open Source, Your Mileage May Vary. Perhaps GTK will improve this aspect
 * of the library in the future.</i>
 * 
 * <a name="spelling"></a>
 * <h2>Spellchecking</h2>
 * 
 * <img class="snapshot" src="TextView-Spelling.png"> You can add
 * spellchecking capability to the TextView with a single line of code.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * view.attachSpell()
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The given code will determine the spellchecker language based on
 * <code>LANG</code> environment variable and fall back to English if it
 * can't.
