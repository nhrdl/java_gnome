/**
 * Present data in CellLayouts (ie, the TreeViewColumns of TreeView, and
 * ComboBox).
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that there is not one CellRenderer per individual cell in the
 * table-like presentation of a TreeView! Instead, a CellRenderer is an engine
 * called upon to draw <i>many</i> cells. The Widget employing them will, by
 * turn, set various properties (the actual data for the current cell in
 * question would be what changes, though most of the rest of the properties
 * would likely remain constant) and then ask the CellRenderer to return the
 * rendered result.
 * 
 * <p>
 * You will see two types of setters in CellRenderers. The most important ones
 * are those that take a DataColumn for an argument, and will adjust that
 * property of the CellRenderer for each row of the model based on the value
 * of the specified column.
 * 
 * <p>
 * While the whole point of the CellRenderers is to present the data from a
 * given column of your data model, CellRenderers also offer a considerable
 * number of properties that you <i>don't</i> need to vary row by row but want
 * to set for the TreeViewColumn as a whole. For these you will notice a a
 * setter which takes a conventional type as its argument; setting this
 * property will set it for all rows in that column. (Occasionally you will
 * see the setter for a property overloaded to offer you both a DataColumn
 * driven mode and a fixed value mode for the rare occasions where both styles
 * are useful, but in general it's fairly obvious that you use a property one
 * way or the other).
 * 
 * <p>
 * It's easy to be tempted into thinking that CellRenderers are Widgets,
 * especially as they get <code>pack()</code>ed into TreeViewColumns on their
 * way to being used in TreeViews. They are, however, merely utility elements
 * that are used to facilitate drawing, and <i>not</i> full power Widgets.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Do not try to reuse a CellRenderer between different TreeViewColumns.
