/**
 * Add scrollbars to a Widget. There are times when you have a Widget which is
 * larger than the area you wish to constrain it to, and the usual way to deal
 * with this is to enhance the Widget with scrollbars. ScrolledWindow is a Bin
 * which enables you to control the scrollbars added in such cases.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Some Widgets have built in support for scrolling; in such cases you add
 * them directly with the usual {@link Container#add(Widget) add()} method;
 * however, if other Widgets need to be enhanced to support scrolling; in such
 * cases you must nest it inside a Viewport; use
 * {@link #addWithViewport(Widget) addWithViewport()} as a quick way to
 * achieve this.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>This is very poorly named. It is <b>not</b> a subclass of Window; it
 * refers instead to a viewport scrolling around on an underlying canvas.</i>
