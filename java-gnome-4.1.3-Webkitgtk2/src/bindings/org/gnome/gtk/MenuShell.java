/**
 * The MenuShell is the abstract super class of {@link Menu} and
 * {@link MenuBar}. It provides the common methods for adding and organizing
 * {@link MenuItem}s.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The following example creates one simple menu with a submenu and adds it to
 * a menu bar:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Menu subMenu = new Menu();
 * subMenu.append(new MenuItem(&quot;Sub Item _1&quot;));
 * subMenu.append(new MenuItem(&quot;Sub Item _2&quot;));
 * MenuItem subMenuItem = new MenuItem(&quot;Sub menu ..&quot;);
 * subMenuItem.setSubmenu(subMenu);
 * 
 * Menu aMenu = new Menu();
 * aMenu.append(new MenuItem(&quot;Item _1&quot;));
 * aMenu.append(new MenuItem(&quot;Item _2&quot;));
 * aMenu.append(subMenuItem);
 * MenuItem aMenuItem = new MenuItem(&quot;_Other menu ..&quot;);
 * aMenuItem.setSubmenu(aMenu);
 * 
 * MenuBar menuBar = new MenuBar();
 * menuBar.append(aMenuItem);
 * // finally add menuBar to the Window's VBox
 * </pre>
