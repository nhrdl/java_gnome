/**
 * A TextBuffer is a powerful mechanism for storing and manipulating text. It
 * exists primarily to be the model that backs the view of one or more
 * paragraphs as presented by the {@link TextView} Widget. Together, these
 * make for a powerful text display and text editing capability, but it does
 * come at the cost of considerable come complexity.
 * 
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * 
 * Creating a TextBuffer is straight forward, as is placing text in it:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * TextBuffer buffer;
 * 
 * buffer = new TextBuffer();
 * buffer.setText(&quot;Hello world!&quot;);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Of course, you rarely just want to write an entire body of text in one go.
 * To insert text in a more piecemeal fashion we use one of the
 * <code>insert()</code> family of methods, but before we can do so, we need
 * to indicate <i>where</i> we want to insert that text. This is the role of
 * {@link TextIter} class.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * TextIter pointer;
 * 
 * pointer = buffer.getIterStart();
 * buffer.insert(pointer, &quot;This is the beginning&quot;);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Note that TextIters are not persistent; as soon as any change is made to
 * the TextBuffer all TextIters are invalidated and you'll need to acquire new
 * ones. If you need a stable reference to a particular position in the text,
 * create a TextMark with {@link #createMark(TextIter, boolean) createMark()}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * As you might expect, a TextBuffer has a notion of a cursor which indicates
 * the (user's) current insertion point. You can get the TextMark representing
 * the cursor, and can use it to insert text or otherwise manipulate a
 * position by converting it to a valid TextIter:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * TextMark cursor;
 * 
 * cursor = buffer.getInsert();
 * ...
 * pointer = cursor.getIter();
 * buffer.insert(pointer, &quot;This text was inserted at the cursor&quot;);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The <code>insertAtCursor()</code> method is a shortcut for this.
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are an incredibly wide range of methods available on the TextIter
 * class for manipulating the position into the TextBuffer that it represents
 * and for finding out more information about the nature of the text at that
 * point. TextIter's {@link TextIter#forwardLine() forwardLine()} is one
 * example; you could use it to count the non-empty lines in a TextBuffer:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * int paragraphs;
 * ...
 * 
 * pointer = buffer.getIterStart();
 * paragraphs = 0;
 * 
 * while (pointer.forwardLine()) {
 *     if (pointer.startsWord()) {
 *         paragraphs++;
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Although trivial, this raises a pitfall you need to be aware of: lines of
 * text in a TextBuffer are <i>not</i> the same as wrapped visible lines in a
 * TextView. Lines in a TextBuffer are a sequences of characters separated by
 * newlines (you don't need a <code>'\n'</code> at the end of the TextBuffer;
 * the end is an implicit line termination). When presented in a TextView with
 * word wrapping enabled, however, each of these lines may take up more than
 * one line on the screen. The term paragraph is used there; see
 * {@link TextIter#forwardDisplayLine(TextView) forwardDisplayLine()} to move
 * a TextIter to the next displayed line within a paragraph as shown on screen
 * in a TextView.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Finally, formatting and other properties can be set on ranges of text. See
 * {@link TextTag}. While these are mostly about visual presentation, they are
 * nevertheless set by applying TextTags to text in the TextBuffer via the
 * {@link #applyTag(TextTag, TextIter, TextIter) applyTag()} and
 * {@link #insert(TextIter, String, TextTag) insert()} methods here.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>These APIs can be somewhat frustrating to use as the methods you need
 * (relative to the order you need them in) tend to be scattered around
 * between TextView, TextBuffer, and TextIter. It was tempting to try and
 * normalize these to a common interface, but in the end we deferred to being
 * faithful to the placement of methods in the underlying library's classes.
 * We have done our best to cross reference our documentation to help you find
 * the "next" logical element when you need it, but if you find yourself
 * struggling to find something and think this documentation could benefit
 * from another such pointer, please feel free to suggest it.</i>
