/**
 * Displaying a tooltip when a user hovers the mouse over the widget or when
 * the widget receives notification the cursor is at it when in keyboard mode.
 * 
 * <p>
 * By default you can set text to show as a tooltip by using
 * {@link Widget#setTooltipText(java.lang.String) } and
 * {@link Widget#setTooltipMarkup(java.lang.String) } . However that is for
 * basic text and only text. If you want more then that you can hookup your
 * own tooltip query handler which in turn will provide an object of this
 * class for you to use.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In order to get an object of this class you first have to connect a
 * queryTooltip Handler.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * // any widget will do
 * widget = new Button();
 * widget.connect(new Widget.queryTooltip() {
 *     &#064;Override
 *     public boolean onQueryTooltip(Widget source, int x, int y, boolean keyboardMode, Tooltip tooltip) {
 *         // setup your tooltip.
 *     }
 * });
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Inside the method you can create your tooltip. You also receive the X and Y
 * values at which you can determine whether to show the tooltip or not. Which
 * is needed for example a TreeView which has a method to help you with. See
 * {@link TreeView#hasTooltipContext(int, int, boolean) } for more information
 * on how a TreeView handles tooltips.
 * 
 * <p>
 * KeyboardMode indicates that the application is run by only the keyboard and
 * no mouse.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When you want to show your tooltip return true, otherwise false.
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are two modes of displaying your tooltip contents. The first is the
 * basic Icon and String. You can set this up in anyway you want. Please do
 * note that both are on the same line and that the icon will always be on the
 * left.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If you want something more fancy or display more information you set any
 * widget to show. Suggested is a container of course. Where you have full
 * freedom to place all your tooltip contents.
