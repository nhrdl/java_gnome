/**
 * A convenient Dialog to show a message to the user.
 * 
 * <p>
 * MessageDialogs are used to show some information message to the user, warn
 * him about application errors or problems, and let him choose what action to
 * take.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A MessageDialog is a simple Dialog with an image representing the type of
 * the message (error, warning, etc... take a look at {@link MessageType
 * MessageType}), the message text and some Buttons to let the user decide how
 * to respond to the message. The {@link ButtonsType ButtonsType} enumeration
 * can be used to choose among some common combination of Buttons, but you can
 * also add other Buttons via the usual Dialog's
 * {@link #addButton(String, ResponseType) addButton()} method.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Optionally you can provide a secondary text that displays more information
 * about the message. Both the main message and the secondary text can be
 * formatted with Pango markup.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In most cases, MessageDialog is a modal Dialog that you will show with the
 * {@link #run() run()} method, and <code>hide()</code> once the user has
 * responded to it, much like in the following example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * // create the Dialog
 * MessageDialog dialog = new MessageDialog(window, true, MessageType.WARNING, ButtonsType.OK_CANCEL,
 *         &quot;Do you want to delete file.txt?&quot;);
 * dialog.setSecondaryText(&quot;If you delete that file, you will loose all the information there&quot;);
 * 
 * // Show the Dialog
 * ResponseType choice = dialog.run();
 * 
 * // Hide it once the user has responded
 * dialog.hide();
 * 
 * // process
 * if (choice == ResponseType.OK) {
 *     // delete the file...
 * } else {
 *     // cancel...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * @see MessageType
 * @see ButtonsType
