/**
 * A Dialog is a special Window which is used to display information for the
 * user or to get response from her. While a normal Window usually is used to
 * represent the whole application and to offer sometimes many interactions
 * for the user, a Dialog should only be opened if a special situation has
 * occurred.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Dialog is a composite Window which contains a {@link VBox}. This box is
 * split by an HSeparator into two areas:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The <var>main area</var> consists of the VBox itself above the separator.
 * It is used to pack Widgets such as Labels or Icons which will display the
 * descriptive part of your Dialog. The easiest way to add Widget(s) to the
 * top area is to simply call the {@link Dialog#add(Widget) add()} method. It
 * is a good technique to first add your own Container such as an {@link HBox}
 * to the top area and pack all other Widgets to it if you need more refined
 * layout control, although this is not compulsory.
 * 
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The bottom <var>action area</var> (actually an HButtonBox) is used to pack
 * buttons to the Dialog which may perform actions such as "Ok" or "Cancel".
 * You should only add Buttons to the <var>action area</var> using one of the
 * {@link Dialog#addButton(String, ResponseType) addButton()} methods allowing
 * you to specify a ResponseType constant to be emitted if the Button is
 * clicked.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * To open the Dialog as a normal non-blocking Window you use the
 * {@link Window#present() present()} method after you have packed the various
 * child elements into it. On the other hand, for occasions where you are
 * using a Dialog to get information required for the further progress of the
 * main application, the {@link Dialog#run() run()} method can be used to open
 * the Dialog. This method blocks the application and waits for response from
 * the user.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Like any Window that you are finished with, you have to
 * {@link Window#hide() hide()} when you receive a
 * <code>Dialog.Response</code> callback, or after {@link Dialog#run() run()}
 * returns.
 * 
 * <p>
 * GTK comes with a number of standard Dialogs which can be used for typical
 * situations such as {@link MessageDialog MessageDialog} to present urgent
 * information to the user, and {@link FileChooserDialog FileChooserDialog}
 * which provides the familiar behaviour of popping up a Dialog to select a
 * file.

     * interface from being used.
     * 
     * <p>
     * A common bug is for people to neglect to {@link Widget#hide() hide()}
     * the Dialog after this method returns. If you don't, then the Dialog
     * will remain on screen despite repeated clicking of (for example) the
     * "Close" Button [the Window is not hidden automatically because of cases
     * like "Apply" in preferences Dialogs and "Open" in FileChoosers when a
     * folder is selected and activation will change directory rather than
     * finishing the Dialog].
     * 
     * <p>
     * While <code>run()</code> can be very useful in callbacks when popping
     * up a quick question, you may find hooking up to the
     * {@link Dialog.Response} signal more flexible.
