/**
 * Support for testing GTK programs.
 * 
 * <p>
 * These functions mess with things pretty heavily; for one thing the mouse
 * will be warped to a position somewhere within the Widget. Needless to say ,
 * the average user doesn't view it very kindly to have their pointer woosh
 * off to another part of the screen. You therefore need to be using this
 * where the display is actually some sort of virtual server, say Xvfb, and
 * not with a live display.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Using <code>sendKey()</code> and <code>sendClick()</code> will inevitably
 * cause actions to occur that are not compatible with simultaneous human user
 * driven input. Obviously these are here to allow you to attempt to simulate
 * user actions, but if you need to click a button programmatically in a
 * normal application, call Button's <code>emitClicked()</code>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>This is not a JUnit TestCase; using that, or any other test framework,
 * is your problem.</i>
