/**
 * Takes an existing model and creates a new model of it sorted as specified.
 * The data is not copied, but the TreeModel that results from creating a
 * TreeModelSort can be used independently. It listens to and reacts to the
 * signals emitted by the underlying base TreeModel. The end result is that of
 * allowing you to have two different TreeViews with their own sort of the
 * same underlying data set. This is potentially useful if you have a common
 * TreeModel backing a number of different presentations, although you should
 * be cognisant that a point will be reached where it is more efficient to
 * simply have separate models.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A TreeIter pointing into this TreeModelSort is <b>not</b> valid in the
 * underlying "child" TreeModel. If you need to change data in the base model,
 * use {@link #convertIterToChildIter(TreeIter) convertIterToChildIter()}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * You need to be careful to use the correct TreeModel for TreeIter pointers
 * you receive in callbacks. The scenario that arises more often is this:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ListStore model;
 * TreeModelSort sorted;
 * TreeView view;
 * TreeSelection selection;
 * 
 * // usual TreeModel setup
 * model = new ListStore(...);
 * 
 * // then create the sorted one, and use it
 * sorted = new TreeModelSort(model);
 * view = new TreeView(sorted);
 * ...
 * 
 * // then, later
 * selection.connect(new TreeSelection.Changed() {
 *     public void onChanged(TreeSelection source) {
 *         final TreeIter row;
 *         final String str;
 * 
 *         row = selection.getSelected();
 *         if (row == null) {
 *             return;
 *         }
 *         str = model.getValue(row, column);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * the problem that arises is that the retrieved TreeIter <i>is not valid</i>
 * in <code>model</code>. It's a TreeIter in <code>sorted</code>. Your program
 * will crash if you get this wrong. The fix is simple; change it to use the
 * correct TreeModel:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ...
 *         str = sorted.getValue(row, column);
 * ...
 * </pre>
 * 
 * and things will work fine.
 * 
 * <p>
 * You don't normally have need of this class. Both ListStore and TreeStore
 * implement TreeSortable already, and there are various sorting tools built
 * into the view side of the TreeView/TreeModel MVC framework, notably
 * TreeViewColumn's {@link TreeViewColumn#setSortColumn(DataColumn)
 * setSortColumn()}. If, however, you are using a {@link TreeModelFilter}, you
 * will need to wrap it in one of these to make sorting work normally again.
