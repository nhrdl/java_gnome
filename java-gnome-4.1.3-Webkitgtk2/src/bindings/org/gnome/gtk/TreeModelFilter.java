/**
 * A TreeModel which can present a subset of its backing model as determined
 * by a filter function. TreeModelFilter acts to wrap an underlying TreeModel.
 * You store your data in this underlying model; the TreeModelFilter just adds
 * the functionality to selectively determine which rows should be visible.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Usage is straight forward. Given the following declarations:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * final ListStore model;
 * final TreeModelFilter filter;
 * final DataColumnInteger elevation;
 * ...
 * </pre>
 * 
 * you initialize and populate your ListStore as usual. To add the filtering
 * functionality, you wrap your ListStore in a TreeModelFilter:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * filter = new TreeModelFilter(model, null);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * then instruct the TreeModelFilter how to select the rows from the concrete
 * TreeModel it is proxying to be included in the virtual model it presents
 * via the {@link #setVisibleCallback(org.gnome.gtk.TreeModelFilter.Visible)
 * setVisibleCallback()}. For instance, if you have a list of all mountains
 * and only want to present peaks higher than 8000 meters, you might do:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * filter.setVisibleCallback(new TreeModelFilter.Visible() {
 *     public boolean onVisible(TreeModelFilter source, TreeModel base, TreeIter row) {
 *         if (base.getValue(row, elevation) &gt; 8000) {
 *             return true;
 *         } else {
 *             return false;
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Assuming you are using this data to back a display Widget such as a
 * TreeView, and you only want to present this filtered list of rows, then you
 * use the TreeModelFilter, not the ListStore, as the model backing the
 * TreeView:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * view = new TreeView(filter);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b><br/>
 * For some reason, TreeModelFilter does <b>not</b> implement TreeSortable. If
 * you plan to sort the filtered model (ie via TreeViewColumn's
 * {@link TreeViewColumn#setSortColumn(DataColumn) setSortColumn()}) make sure
 * you wrap your TreeModelFilter in a {@link TreeModelSort} and add that to
 * the TreeView instead:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * store = new ListStore(...);
 * filtered = new TreeModelFilter(store, null);
 * sorted = new TreeModelSort(filtered);
 * 
 * view = new TreeView(sorted);
 * 
 * vertical = view.appendColumn();
 * vertical.setSortColumn(...);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * otherwise GTK will object vociferously.
