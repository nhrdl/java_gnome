/**
 * A Widget that contains at least one, and maybe more, other Widgets.
 * Container is the base of the GTK box packing model; all layouts are
 * composed of Widgets that are packed into other Widgets.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Containers fall into two major categories. They are either:
 * <dl>
 * <dt><b>decorators</b>
 * <dd>Containers which add something around a Widget. Examples include
 * {@link Button Button} (adding the push button aspect to a Widget) and
 * {@link Window Window} (the top level Widget which adds window decorations
 * via the window manager); <i>or</i>
 * <dt><b>layout</b>
 * <dd>Containers which control the layout of other Widgets within a user
 * interface. Examples include the simplistic {@link Fixed Fixed} layout tool,
 * the ubiquitous {@link Box Box} subclasses like VBox and HBox, and the more
 * advanced packing mechanisms like {@link Table}.
 * </dl>
 * 
 * <h2>Size Requests and Size Allocation</h2>
 * <p>
 * Containers intermediate in GTK's box packing process. Each Container
 * aggregates the requests from its children during the <i>size request</i>
 * phase, and then later, as actual screen real estate is granted to it, the
 * Container must then divide that space amongst each of its children in the
 * <i>size allocation</i> phase.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For more information about how this works, and on how you can influence it
 * if necessary, see Widget's {@link Widget#setSizeRequest(int, int)
 * setSizeRequest()}. To get an indication of how much space has been (will
 * be) requested by a child, a Container will also find the
 * {@link Widget#getRequisition() getRequisition()} method useful. The Actual
 * size granted is available at {@link Widget#getAllocation() getAllocation()}
 * once the box packing cycle has been carried out.

     * find this out is to walk the Widget hierarchy.
