/**
 * A stable reference to a specific row in a TreeModel. A TreeRowReference
 * listens to all changes made to the model (be they insertions, deletions,
 * sorting being applied, etc) and adjusts itself internally so that the same
 * row is pointed at by the instance regardless.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class is primarily necessary because a TreeIter instance is no longer
 * usable if the model changes. Neither are TreePaths for that matter; if you
 * change the sorting order then the row pointed at by TreePath "2" will
 * [likely] be different before and after the sort.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Typical usage of this is from a TreeIter as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * TreeModel source;
 * TreePath path;
 * TreeIter row;
 * TreeRowReference ref;
 * ...
 * 
 * path = source.getPath(row);
 * ref = new TreeRowReference(source, path);
 * </pre>
