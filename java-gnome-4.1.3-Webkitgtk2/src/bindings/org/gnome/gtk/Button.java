 * Button by calling {@link #setImage(Image) setImage()}; this works alongside
 * and with {@link #setLabel(String) setLabel()}. The machinery within Button
 * will manage creating the necessary internal structure (HBoxes, Alignments,
 * etc).

     * Event generated when a user presses and releases a button, causing it

     * emitted, but only if the cursor is still in the Button when the mouse
     * button is released. You're probably used to this behaviour without
     * realizing it.</i>
     * 
     * <h2>All about signal handling</h2>
     * 
     * <h3>Use an anonymous inner class</h3>
     * 
     * <p>
     * In general, the way that java-gnome is intended to be used is for you
     * to create an anonymous inner class right where you call the
     * <code>connect()</code> method to hook up the signal. A typical example
     * is as follows:
     * 
     * <pre>
     * final Button b;
     * 
     * b.connect(new Button.Clicked() {
     *     public void onClicked(Button source) {
     *         doSomething();
     *     }
     * }
     * </pre>
     * 
     * This is the form we recommend; it has the advantage that your handler
     * code is close to the code that declares and configures the Widget.
     * Also, if variables are declared <code>final</code> then you can access
     * them from within the nested anonymous class, and that makes things easy
     * indeed.
     * 
     * <h3>Using a concrete instance</h3>
     * 
     * <p>
     * If you have more complex code, perhaps that you need to reuse across
     * several Widgets, then you can of course create a concrete class that
     * implements Button.Clicked and then use instances of it if you have
     * highly complicated algorithms to implement:
     * 
     * <pre>
     * class ComplexHandler implements Button.Clicked
     * {
     *     private int field;
     * 
     *     ComplexHandler(int param) {
     *         this.field = param;
     *     }
     * 
     *     public void onClicked(Button source) {
     *         doSomethingVeryComplicatedWith(field);
     *     }
     * }
     * </pre>
     * 
     * and then when you construct the Button:
     * 
     * <pre>
     * b = new Button();
     * b.connect(new ComplexHandler(42));
     * </pre>
     * 
     * You can just as easily declare one and reuse it if you want to apply
     * the same logic to a series of Button; this is where the
     * <code>source</code> parameter that every signal callback signature
     * includes.
     * 
     * <pre>
     * final ComplexHandler handler;
     * 
     * handler = new ComplexHandler(42);
     * ...
     * b1.connect(handler);
     * b2.connect(handler);
     * b3.connect(handler);
     * ...
     * </pre>
     * 
     * <h3>Self-delegation</h3>
     * 
     * <p>
     * If you implement Button.Clicked in the class you're currently working
     * on, then you use a technique called "self-delegation" which can be
     * useful in certain circumstances:
     * 
     * <pre>
     * b.connect(this);
     * </pre>
     * 
     * This has disadvantage that you can only have one
     * <code>onClicked()</code> method in your class, so if you have lots of
     * Buttons then you lose the benefit of being able to connect different
     * handlers to different Buttons.
     * 
     * <p>
     * We recommend you use anonymous inner classes in-place whenever
     * possible. In our experience, having the handler logic next to the code
     * that declares an instance dramatically improves readability.
