/**
 * Accelerator are for key bindings for windows. For example, <b>
 * <code>Ctrl+O</code></b> is the typical accelerator for opening a file.
 * Accelerator in this case refers to pressing these keys together and the
 * action that results.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When a key binding is pressed the action related to the Widget is being
 * activated. Therefore each key binding is directly tied to the Widget in
 * question. You generally only need one AcceleratorGroup object per Window.
 * Create one, then tell the toplevel about it with Window's
 * {@link Window#addAcceleratorGroup(AcceleratorGroup) addAcceleratorGroup()}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Key bindings are only bound to MenuItems or Actions. For example, given a
 * Window, a Menu, and a MenuItem, we setup an AcceleratorGroup for the
 * toplevel and then assign a key binding to the MenuItem:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * group = new AcceleratorGroup();
 * window.addAcceleratorGroup(group);
 * ..
 * menu.setAcceleratorGroup(group);
 * item.setAccelerator(group, Keyval.O, ModifierType.CONTROL_MASK);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * For ImageMenuItem you can either use the key binding that is associated
 * with it through the Stock item and only invoke:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * imageitem.setAccelerator(group);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * or you can set a custom key binding through the method from parent class
 * MenuItem:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * imageitem.setAccelerator(group, Keyval.N, ModifierType.CONTROL_MASK);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In order to set multiple Modifier Types you can use the static method
 * {@link ModifierType#or(ModifierType, ModifierType) or()}
