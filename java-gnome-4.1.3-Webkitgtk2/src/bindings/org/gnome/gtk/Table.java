/**
 * A Container which arranges child Widgets in particular rows and columns.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Table is <b>not</b> a spreadsheet Widget! For that you would need to have
 * (say) a sea of Entry Widgets that were all hooked up to behave the same
 * (notably to pass focus between them appropriately) and which were
 * individually constrained to each be the same size (at least by default),
 * etc. By contrast, Table is for laying out Widgets in a grid but where each
 * child can happily request the size it needs.
 * 
 * <p>
 * To be honest, this Widget is a pain in the ass to use because you have to
 * manually keep track of which <code>row,column</code> edges a Widget is to
 * be constrained by. In most cases you can achieve the same alignment effects
 * with far greater flexibility by using HBoxes nested in VBoxes and
 * controlling the size allocations via {@link SizeGroup}s.

     * layout control for the Widget being added, mostly achieved using the
     * {@link AttachOptions}.
     * 
     * <p>
     * To define that a Widget shall grow on the x-axis, but keep the size on
     * the y-axis you would do:
     * 
     * <pre>
     * table.attach(child, 3, 4, 1, 2, AttachOptions.EXPAND, AttachOptions.SHRINK, 0, 0);
     * </pre>
     * 
     * <p>
     * A common problem is that you have Widgets of different sizes (e.g.
     * labels in a column). If a widget is smaller than the required space
     * additional padding is added to the sides, so finally the smaller Widget
     * is centered compared to the larger Widget. To avoid this you a) need to
     * encapsulate the Widget in an {@link Alignment} Container and b) need to
     * attach it here using <code>AttachOptions.FILL</code>, so that instead
     * of additional space being added to the sides, the
     * <code>Alignment</code> Container may decide how to distribute it.
     * 
     * <p>
     * The following example left-aligns the child Widget within its cell,
     * while it is vertically centered:
     * 
     * <pre>
     * final Alignment aligned;
     * 
     * aligned = new Alignment(Alignment.LEFT, Alignment.CENTER, 1.0f, 1.0f, child);
     * table.attach(aligned, 3, 4, 1, 2, AttachOptions.FILL, AttachOptions.FILL, 0, 0);
