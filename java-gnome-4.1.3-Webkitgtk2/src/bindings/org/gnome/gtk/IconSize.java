 * We're rather deliberately <i>not</i> indicated the pixel dimensions
 * associated with each IconSize constant, as this is the sort of thing that

 * In some sense you don't need this; when working with Stock items in
 * conjunction with Buttons or Menus, the images will be arranged to be the
 * appropriate size automatically.
