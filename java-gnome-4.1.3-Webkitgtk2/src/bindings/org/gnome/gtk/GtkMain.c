 * synchronized block. This works around a strange behaviour in Eclipse and
 * hopefully results in a better debugging experience.
 *
 * Note that the main loop implicitly uses the gdk_threads_enter/leave()

 * held upon making this call (which blocks), the lock is released briefly
 * each time the main loop iterates.
