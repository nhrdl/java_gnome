/**
 * A mechanism allowing a user to copy data between programs.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Clipboards were originally for sharing data between different processes,
 * but of course conventional practise these days is that cut, copy and paste
 * are used quite ubiquitously both as a way to copy things from one program
 * to another, as well as simply moving data around within an application.
 * 
 * <p>
 * You can copy text to the main system Clipboard quite simply, as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * clipboard = Clipboard.getDefault();
 * clipboard.setText(&quot;Hello there&quot;);
 * </pre>

/*
 * TODO The underlying GtkClipboard is wildly complex and very powerful,
 * allowing for asynchronous data transfer. If anything, it seems a bit
 * overboard, and perhaps a simpler synchronous implementation would be handy.
 * Regardless, someone will have to manually set up signals to proxy for these
 * callbacks as at time of writing we don't have a [generated] way to
 * automatically represent function pointers. See the native code underneath
 * TreeModelFilter's setVisibleCallback() for an example.
