/**
 * A logical but abstract representation of a row in a TreeModel. TreePaths
 * can be expressed as Strings.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Paths in ListStores are quite simple. They are a simple number,
 * incrementing from zero, indicating the row number. For example,
 * <code>TreePath("8")</code> is the ninth row in the model.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Paths for TreeStores are more complex. They are of the form
 * "first:second:third:..." where each of first, second, and third denote the
 * number of steps in from the first at each level of the hierarchy. For
 * example, <code>TreePath("2:4:0")</code> represents the first third level
 * element in the fifth second level element in the third row.
 * 
 * <p>
 * TreePaths are given to you as a row address in signals like
 * {@link TreeView.RowActivated}. Usually you need the row expressed as a
 * TreeIter (ie to get a value out of the row);to do that call the underlying
 * TreeModel's {@link TreeModel#getIter(TreePath) getIter()} method.
