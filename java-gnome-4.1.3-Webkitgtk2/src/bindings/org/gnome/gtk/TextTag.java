/**
 * TextTags are used to apply markup and formatting for regions of text in a
 * TextBuffer.
 * 
 * <p>
 * All TextTags belong to a TextTagTable, and likewise all TextBuffers are
 * constructed by specifying the TextTagTable that it will draw tags from.
 * That said, if you don't mind sharing your TextTags between all TextBuffers
 * in your application, then you can use the no-arg convenience constructors
 * here and in TextBuffer. We will in all our examples.
 * 
 * <p>
 * You can create a new and unique TextTag every time you go to apply
 * formatting, but in general you'll want to reuse them and that will be more
 * efficient. Given:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * TextTag bold;
 * TextBuffer buffer;
 * TextIter start, end, pointer;
 * ...
 * </pre>
 * 
 * and assuming the TextBuffer was created with the no-arg constructor, create
 * a TextTag and apply some formatting:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * bold = new TextTag();
 * bold.setWeight(Weight.BOLD);
 * ...
 * </pre>
 * 
 * As you will see, there are any number of properties and font
 * characteristics that can be applied with a tag. See the setter methods on
 * this class for all the current possibilities.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Now, to make use of the tag, you'll call TextBuffer's
 * {@link TextBuffer#applyTag(TextTag, TextIter, TextIter) applyTag()}. It
 * needs a pair of TextIters to delineate the range you want to apply the
 * TextTag to. You could, for example, react to the currently selected region:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * start = buffer.getSelectionBound().getIter();
 * end = buffer.getInsert().getIter();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * And now apply your tag:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * buffer.applyTag(bold, start, end);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * As an alternative, you can apply a TextTag when
 * {@link TextBuffer#insert(TextIter, String, TextTag) insert()}ing text:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * buffer.insert(pointer, &quot;Hello World&quot;, bold);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Either way, going forward, you've now got <code>bold</code> which you can
 * apply on other regions of your TextBuffer.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Finally, if you want to know what TextTags are applying at a given spot in
 * a TextBuffer, then get a TextIter pointing there and use its
 * {@link TextIter#getTags() getTags()} method.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>All TextTags created in java-gnome are "anonymous"; the underlying
 * library has a notion of named tags but we have no need of this and have not
 * exposed it. In order to reuse a TextTag later just keep a reference to
 * it.</i>
