/**
 * The data use as the model backing a {@link TreeView}. TreeModel comes in
 * two flavours which actually store data: {@link ListStore}, for a list of
 * rows, and {@link TreeStore}, for data which has a hierarchical relationship
 * between the rows.
 * 
 * <p>
 * TreeModels are tabular, and as such have "columns", each of which is
 * strongly typed, and which are represented in java-gnome by the
 * {@link DataColumn DataColumn} classes.
 * 
 * <p>
 * While the "columns" (and their types) must be declared when instantiating a
 * TreeModel, the "rows" in a TreeModel are dynamic; it grows as you add data
 * to the model. An instance of {@link TreeIter TreeIter} points to an
 * individual row in a TreeModel; these are used both when adding new rows and
 * when dealing with identifying which row has been selected in a TreeView. Be
 * warned that TreeIters are <i>very</i> transient and are only valid so long
 * as you haven't changed the structure of the model (ie, by adding another
 * row, sorting it, filtering it, etc) so when populating a TreeModel we tend
 * to do so one complete row at a time.
 * 
 * <h2>Populating TreeModels</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * You add data to a TreeModel by first calling <code>appendRow()</code> which
 * returns a TreeIter pointing to the new row, and then using the
 * <code>setValue()</code> method appropriate to the data type of each column
 * [<code>setValue()</code> has an overload for each concrete DataColumn type,
 * so if you've declared the columns as fully derived DataColumnString or
 * DataColumnInteger or whatever (as recommended), the following will Just
 * Work]:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * final DataColumnString column;
 * final ListStore model;
 * TreeIter row;
 * 
 * row = model.appendRow();
 * model.setValue(row, column, &quot;King George V&quot;);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * You'll note that in this example we called the TreeIter <code>row</code>
 * and the DataColumn <code>column</code>; doing so made the first two
 * arguments of each of the <code>setValue()</code> methods make sense: you
 * are setting a <var>value</var> in the ListStore or TreeStore at the
 * co-ordinates <var>row</var>, <var>column</var>. In practise, of course, you
 * have many DataColumns,
 * 
 * <pre>
 * final DataColumnString monarchNameColumn;
 * final DataColumnInteger coronatedYearColumn;
 * final DataColumnPixbuf portraitColumn;
 * final DataColumnReference monarchObjectColumn;
 * final ListStore model;
 * TreeIter row;
 * Pixbuf portrait;
 * ...
 * 
 * row = model.appendRow();
 * model.setValue(row, monarchNameColumn, &quot;King George V&quot;);
 * model.setValue(row, coronatedYearColumn, 1910);
 * model.setValue(row, portraitColumn, portrait);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * There is a special kind of DataColumn for storing references to Java
 * objects, DataColumnReference. This is used so that you can find your way
 * back to the domain object model that your data came from in the first
 * place. Indeed, the above code would probably have been done as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Monarch george;
 * ...
 * 
 * row = model.appendRow();
 * model.setValue(row, monarchNameColumn, george.getFormalName());
 * model.setValue(row, coronatedYearColumn, george.getCoronationYear());
 * model.setValue(row, portraitColumn, george.getPortrait());
 * model.setValue(row, monarchObjectColumn, george);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * (assuming we created our model with such a DataColumnReference in the first
 * place). The key part is the last line, where we store [a reference to] the
 * object itself in the model.
 * 
 * <h2>Retrieving data</h2>
 * 
 * You can retrieve data from a TreeModel with the same <var>row</var>,
 * <var>column</var> co-ordinates used when storing data:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * String name;
 * 
 * name = model.getValue(row, column);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The <code>row</code> TreeIter in this case usually comes from a TreeView
 * {@link TreeView.RowActivated} signal or a TreeSelection
 * {@link TreeSelection.Changed} signal. You can also get a TreeIter for a
 * specific row via <code>getIter()</code>. Less frequently you will want to
 * iterate over all the rows in the model, which is possible as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * row = model.getIterFirst();
 * do {
 *     name = model.getValue(row, column);
 *     // do something with name
 * } while (row.iterNext());
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Although we have illustrated getting a String out of the TreeModel here,
 * you will normally only need to retrieve the Java object from your domain
 * model from which the data in this row was derived and which it represents:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ruler = (Monarch) model.getValue(row, monarchObjectColumn);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * once you have the Java object that has been "selected" by the user in your
 * TreeView in hand, you can carry on from there with your application logic.
 * 
 * <p>
 * As discussed in the documentation for DataColumn, TreeModels are only
 * really meant as the backing store for a TreeView. By in large, you only use
 * them as the means to drive what is being displayed by a TreeView; there's
 * no reason to try and store a complex domain model in a GTK TreeModel. [By
 * analogy, the String you pass to Label's <code>setLabel()</code> is merely
 * setting the <var>label</var> property which is the "data store" backing the
 * text displayed by the Label. You only push down what you want displayed;
 * the rest of your data model stays in Java, of course. It's the same with
 * TreeView]
