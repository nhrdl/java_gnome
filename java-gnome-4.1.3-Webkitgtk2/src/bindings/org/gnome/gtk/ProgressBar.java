/**
 * A Widget that displays the progress of a task as a visual bar. This is
 * principally used to give feedback to a user that things are actually
 * happening when some computationally intensive or long running task is
 * taking place. You can use a ProgressBar in two ways. Usually you know what
 * fraction of a task is complete and that is what you want to display as a
 * steadily increasing bar. On the other hand, if the total duration of the
 * task is unknown or unpredictable, you can still indicate progress is being
 * made by having the bar "pulse" back and forth.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that like most things in GTK, most of the code that actually updates
 * the ProgressBar will not run until control is returned to the main loop.
 * Keep that in mind if you're wondering why the bar hasn't "updated".

     * <p>
     * An example of this is web: most URLs addressable via
     * <code>http://</code> are files of known size, and so when downloading
     * them, a web browser can report exactly what percentage has been
     * downloaded relative to the file size that was psssed in the initial
     * HTTP header. Dynamic web pages, on the other hand (ie, your average PHP
     * or JSP script), do not have a known size at the time the HTTP headers
     * are sent, and so the web browser doesn't know ahead of time how many
     * bytes are on the way. In this scenario, all the application can do is
     * "pulse" the ProgressBar back and forth to indicate that traffic is
     * continuing to arrive but that the percentage complete is not known, and
     * that is what this method is for.
     * 
     * <p>
     * Each time this method is invoked, the a little block inside the
     * ProgressBar is moved a small amount. You should therefore call this
     * method fairly frequently (ie with reasonably small time intervals) to
     * cause the effect of the block moving back and forward along the
     * ProgressBar.
