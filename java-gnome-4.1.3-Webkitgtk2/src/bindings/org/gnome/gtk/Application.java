/**
 * This class handles the lifecycle of a java-gnome application. It ensures
 * that the application is unique and manages a list of top-level windows
 * whose life-cycle is automatically tied to the life-cycle of the
 * application.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Applications are unique in your desktop session; once the program is
 * running subsequent invocations of the binary will result in a signal being
 * sent to the original, known as the "<var>primary</var>" instance.
 * 
 * <p>
 * You can model several different program styles this way. A straight forward
 * and common use is for subsequent invocations merely to "wake" the primary,
 * perhaps bringing it to front. In this example, you start by constructing an
 * Application object:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * app = new Application(&quot;com.example.MasterControlProgram&quot;);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * in this case "registering" the DBus name
 * <code>com.example.MasterControlProgram</code> as the unique identifier for
 * this application. As with a plain GTK program, you then enter the main
 * loop, but instead of <code>Gtk.main()</code> you use Application's
 * {@link #run(String[]) run()} to do so:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * app.run(args);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * the original process blocks in this call (and runs a GTK main loop and your
 * widgets start receiving event signals). Subsequent programs attempting to
 * register that name (ie, this same code being run through a second time but
 * by a different invocation of your program) will implicitly discover that
 * they are <i>not</i> the <var>primary</var> instance; the <var>remote</var>
 * will return from the call to <code>run()</code> although how fast this
 * occurs depends on actions the <var>primary</var> takes.
 * 
 * <h2>Signals</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The <code>Application.Startup</code> will be fired once for an instance
 * when it becomes <var>primary</var>. So, that's the place to put your UI
 * setup code.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>Application.Activate</code> will occurs when when Application's
 * {@link #activate() activate()} is called. It is also raised when the
 * primary begins running the first time if no flags were passed to the
 * Application constructor.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If the application has been configured as passing command line arguments
 * from <var>remote</var> instances to the <var>primary</var>, then instead of
 * <code>Application.Activate</code>, the <code>Application.CommandLine</code>
 * signal will be raised on the <var>primary</var>. You can always call
 * <code>activate()</code> from this handler thereby concentrating the code to
 * deal with raising the UI there.
 * 
 * <h2>Life cycle</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * For each principle GTK Window you create, call Application's
 * {@link #addWindow(Window) addWindow()} and be sure to put a call to
 * Application's {@link Application#removeWindow(Window) removeWindow()} in
 * that Window's <code>Window.DeleteEvent</code> handler. The runtime system
 * will keep track of these registered Windows; your application will
 * terminate when the last one is destroyed.
 * 
 * <p>
 * You can also call Application's {@link Application#quit() quit()} to exit
 * the program.
 * 
 * <h2>Initialization</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The call to <code>Gtk.init()</code> or creating a
 * <code>new Application()</code> <b>must</b> be the first thing done in your
 * program.
