/**
 * A TextIter defines a position inside a {@link TextBuffer} and allows you to
 * manipulate it.
 * 
 * <p>
 * TextIters are just used for immediate operations, and are invalidated any
 * time when the TextBuffer's contents change. If you need to hold a reference
 * to a specific position, convert this TextIter into a TextMark with
 * TextBuffer's {@link TextBuffer#createMark(TextIter, boolean) createMark()}.
 * 
 * <h2>Navigation</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Quite a number of methods on TextIter allow you to move the location of the
 * pointer in the TextBuffer, including {@link #forwardLine() forwardLine()},
 * {@link #backwardChars(int) backwardChars()}, and many others. These are
 * both imperative commands and a means of querying. The TreeIter will attempt
 * to move as requested, while the boolean return value of the call will tell
 * you <i>whether</i> the TreeIter changed location. This can be used to
 * ascertain your position in a logical sense or to limit loops. Remeber,
 * however, that (unless otherwise marked) any method which changes the
 * TextBuffer invalidates the TextIters pointing into it.
