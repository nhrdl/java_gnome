/**
 * Each TextView is actually composed from a number of underlying
 * [org.gnome.gdk] Windows. In addition to the core one where the text entry
 * happens, there are a number of optional Windows which can be used as side
 * panels. This class specifies constants identifying these underlying
 * resources.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The {@link #TEXT TEXT} Window is where most of the work happens; use
 * Textview's {@link TextView#getWindow(TextWindowType) getWindow(TEXT)}
 * rather than Widget's <code>getWindow()</code> and can be used if you need
 * to work out relative positioning.
 * 
 * <p>
 * On the other hand there are border windows, specified by <code>LEFT</code>,
 * <code>TOP</code>, etc. <b>These border Windows are an obscure, advanced,
 * and not wholly functional feature of GTK.</b> The accompanying illustration
 * is a TextView with each border window specified to a width of 50 pixels and
 * a Label placed at <i>window co-ordinates</i> <code>0</code>,<code>0</code>
 * in each one. <img class="snapshot" src="TextView-BorderWindows.png">
 * 
 * Code to create this snapshot consisted of a series of calls like:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * left = new Label(&quot;LEFT&quot;);
 * view.setBorderWindowSize(TextWindowType.LEFT, 50);
 * view.add(left, TextWindowType.LEFT, 0, 0);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * one for each side. Note the positions and relative sizes of the scrollbars
 * added by the ScrolledWindow into which the TextView was placed. As you can
 * see, only the left border window one makes very much sense, as it could be
 * used for things like breakpoint annotations in a programming editor.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>WARNING</b><br>
 * <i style="color:red">By all accounts, this feature is still evolving in
 * GTK; it is entirely possible that it was not completely implemented in the
 * first place, and in any case the interface for using it seems ... unsteady.
 * We have included this in java-gnome largely because we had already gone to
 * all the work of exposing it only to discover that it is exceedingly hard to
 * use and somewhat buggy. Hopefully GTK will improve, but if you use this,
 * expect the behaviour to be somewhat unpredictable.</i>
