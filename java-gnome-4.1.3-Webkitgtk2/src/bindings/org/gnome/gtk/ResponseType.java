/**
 * Predefined responses for a {@link Dialog Dialog}. Each ResponseType is
 * usually associated with a preconfigured action Button in the Dialog, but
 * can also come from other Widgets or user actions, such as closing the
 * Window.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If one of these responses constants fits your needs, it is recommended that
 * you make use of it. This is partly for code clarity but mostly because
 * there are a number of special behaviours within GTK which presume you're
 * using the correct predefined constants. This is especially the case in
 * FileChooserDialog.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If your needs require it, however, you can define your own responses codes
 * by extending this class. For example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public class PowerResponseType extend ResponseType
 * {
 *     protected PowerResponseType(String nickname) {
 *         super(nickname);
 *     }
 *     
 *     public static final PowerResponseType SQUARED = new PowerResponseType(&quot;SQUARED&quot;);
 *     
 *     public static final PowerResponseType CUBED = new PowerResponseType(&quot;CUBED&quot;);
 *     
 *     public static final PowerResponseType FOURTH = new PowerResponseType(&quot;FOURTH&quot;);
 * }
 * </pre>

/*
 * This is an exception to the usual usage of enumerated Constants. First,
 * although it is an enum, its values in Gtk+ doesn't grow incrementally from
 * 0. They're all negative values, because positive values are reserved for
 * user usage. Therefore we have hacked the .defs data to be (define-flags
 * ...) to force the generated translation layer to reach to native for the
 * ordinals. The other difference is that the developer can define their own
 * codes to be associated with specific actions, and we provide the mechanism
