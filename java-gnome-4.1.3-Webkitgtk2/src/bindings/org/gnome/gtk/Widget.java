     * another Window or because it was offscreen).
     * 
     * <p>
     * GNOME uses the excellent <a href="http://www.cairographics.org/">Cairo
     * 2D graphics library</a> to draw its user interfaces, which we make
     * available in java-gnome in package <code>org.freedesktop.cairo</code>.
     * 
     * <p>
     * Code that does drawing needs to be written a little differently than
     * code which just builds Widgets up into user interfaces. While we are
     * accustomed to doing setting up various Widgets and packing them into
     * Windows in our constructors, the one thing you cannot easily do there
     * is graphics drawing. In order to be able to construct the Context used
     * for drawing operations, Cairo needs the details of the [org.gnome.gdk]
     * Display, Screen and Window it will be drawing to, and these are not
     * available until the Widget has been realized and mapped. The
     * <code>Widget.Draw</code> signal is emitted exactly at this point, and
     * so that's when we have the environment we need to do our drawing.
     * 
     * <p>
     * To do drawing with Cairo you need a Context, and GTK 3 conveniently
     * provides you with one all ready to go:
     * 
     * <pre>
     * foo.connect(new Widget.Draw() {
     *     public boolean onDraw(Widget source, Context cr) {
     *        // start drawing
     *     }
     * }
     * </pre>
     * 
     * GTK makes calls to Context's <code>save()</code> and
     * <code>restore()</code> around the <code>Widget.Draw</code> signal so
     * you don't worry about having to reset the Context to its initial state.

     * modern graphical user interfaces, them <i>releasing</i> a key is when a
     * program should take action if action is called for. For example, if
     * they press and hold the <b><code>Enter</code></b> key while the pointer
     * is over a Button, but then move the mouse off of that Button,
     * subsequently releasing won't cause that Button to activate).
     * 
     * <p>
     * When hooking this up, you'll probably be wanting the key that was hit.
     * That's accomplished with Call <code>event.getKeyval()</code> as in:
