/**
 * An icon that is displayed in the notification area.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A StatusIcon is an element that can be added to a notification area. It can
 * be used to display information about user events that may occur (events in
 * the sense of "something interesting", not as in GTK event signal). Examples
 * of user events may be a new email notification, or an incoming instant
 * message, or a completed file transfer. StatusIcons can be used to display
 * information of an activity that is occurring in the background, such as a
 * print job or a file copy activity. A third way of using the StatusIcon
 * capability is to monitor an existing resource; two existing examples are
 * laptop battery charge state from <code>gnome-power-manager</code> and the
 * state of a wireless network connection from NetworkManager's
 * <code>nm-applet</code> program.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Using a StatusIcon in the notification area is generally less annoying than
 * popping up a {@link org.gnome.gtk.Dialog}, but they are also less likely to
 * catch user attention. Thus a StatusIcon can be used to inform the user of
 * an important event, but not necessarily an urgent event.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A StatusIcon can also have an associated tooltip, not to be confused with
 * {@link org.gnome.gtk.Tooltip}. This tooltip appears in a balloon at the
 * StatusIcon itself and can be used to convey additional information.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Do not use as a substitute for writing an applet!</b>. StatusIcons are
 * frequently abused and/or over used. Only add one to your application if it
 * conveys critical status information to the user. If it has a more
 * utilitarian and full-time purpose, it should really be in an applet. In
 * fact, the power and network examples above are both borderline. The battery
 * state in particular should probably be an applet and may well move back to
 * being one; the major argument to make it an applet is to give the user
 * control over where the battery status is positioned on the panel; the
 * counter argument is that in the new power management program, the battery
 * charge state display is transitory and (by default) not shown when not
 * charging. As you can see, it's a complex issue.
 * 
 * <p>
 * It's essential to keep in mind that the Notification Area is itself a panel
 * applet; if one isn't running the image displayed by the StatusIcon may not
 * visible to the user. This is another reason to consider writing an
 * applet... or just go all the way and write a proper daemon program. See the
 * GNOME Human Interface Guidelines for more detailed information and
 * policies.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>As it happens, StatusIcon does not derive from Widget for historical
 * reasons related to the inability of some other platforms to adhere to the
 * FreeDesktop standards properly.</i>
