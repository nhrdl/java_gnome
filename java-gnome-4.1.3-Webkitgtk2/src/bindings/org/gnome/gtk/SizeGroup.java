/**
 * Cause a group of Widgets to have the same size request in either the
 * horizontal dimension, the vertical dimension, or both. A SizeGroup is
 * somewhat like a Container, although it is a helper class for Widgets and
 * not itself a Widget. When you create a SizeGroup, you specify the mode
 * indicating the way you want it to act upon the Widgets placed into it, and
 * then add Widgets. All the Widgets "in" the SizeGroup will then all have
 * have their width request in common ({@link SizeGroupMode#HORIZONTAL
 * HORIZONTAL}) or their height request in common (
 * {@link SizeGroupMode#VERTICAL VERTICAL}), or, in somewhat rarer
 * circumstances, have both their width and height requests in common
 * {@link SizeGroupMode#BOTH BOTH}). The size requested will be that of the
 * Widget in the group that is the largest in that dimension.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When doing data entry across a large number of fields, it is a GNOME
 * usability standard that the Entry boxes be common width and aligned
 * vertically. While there are certainly cases where you have a good reason
 * for doing otherwise, if you are filling in a form then using a SizeGroup
 * can help you create a nice uniform appearance.
 * 
 * <p>
 * SizeGroups can be fantastically useful to create the "table" effect but
 * across an uneven series of HBoxes nested in VBoxes with but with other
 * things in between.
