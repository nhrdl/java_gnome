/**
 * A stable reference to a specific position within a TextBuffer.
 * 
 * <p>
 * TextIters are transient pointers to positions within TextBuffers which are
 * invalidated when their TextBuffer is modified, so you can't "save" them. If
 * you need to preserve a position for later reuse, then get a TextMark by
 * calling TextBuffer's {@link TextBuffer#createMark(TextIter, boolean)
 * createMark()} on it.
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are two "standard" TextMarks available in all TextBuffers, relating
 * to the cursor and the current selection. See {@link TextBuffer#getInsert()
 * getInsert()} and {@link TextBuffer#getSelectionBound() getSelectionBound()}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class fill the same role for TextBuffers that
 * {@link TreeRowReference} does in providing stability for rows pointed to
 * transiently by TreeIters that come from TreeModels.

     * The usual caveats about changes invalidating iterators apply, but if

     * repeatedly, however, and not changing the TextBuffer, then it is far
     * more efficient to convert the TextMark into a TextIter once and use
     * that directly.
