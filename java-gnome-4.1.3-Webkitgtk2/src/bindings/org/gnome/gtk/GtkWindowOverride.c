/*
 * We run into problems with the default GtkWindow memory management.
 * The default behaviour for 'delete-event' is to propegate to the dispose
 * code path, which among other things, releases all its child GtkWidgets.
 * The GtkWindow itself is not released, however, because we could still hold
 * a valid ToggleRef to it if we still have a reference on the Java side to
 * the Java side Proxy; show()ing the Window again is possible, but if you do
 * its contents will be gone.
 *
 * To work around this we use a bit of GTK hackery. First we block
 * 'delete-event' from propegating into dispose, and instead just hide() the
 * window. Then we take advantage of there is an internal property
 * called GtkWindow->has_user_ref_count. By overriding it to 0 we can tell
 * GTK that we are managing the Ref to the GtkWindow representing it being on
 * screen, and we can safely drop GTK's Ref to the GtkWindow. Finally, in
 * operation, we restore this Ref count on windows that are show()n and
 * re-remove it on hide(). Thus a hidden GtkWindow that is also not strongly
 * referenced from any Java code will be eligigble for cleanup.
 *
 * Thanks to Owen Taylor for having researched these scenarios and in
 * particular for having verified that the 'hide' signal is indeed emitted by
 * gtk_widget_dispose(). The original suggestion to leverage the 'show' and
 * 'hide' signals was from Vreixo Formoso.
