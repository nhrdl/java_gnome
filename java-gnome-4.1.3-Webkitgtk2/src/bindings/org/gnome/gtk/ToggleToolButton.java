/**
 * A ToggleToolButton is a ToolButton that retains its state.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The usual usage of such kind of ToolButtons is to let users enable or
 * disable an application feature.
 * 
 * <p>
 * You can check the current state of the ToggleToolButton using the
 * {@link #getActive()} method. Additionally you can connect to the
 * {@link ToggleToolButton.TOGGLED TOGGLED} signal to respond to changes in
 * the <var>active</var> state.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Beware that ToogleToolButtons have sometimes fared poorly in usability
 * tests. The problem is that they are an exception: most ToolItems are
 * ToolButtons, and most of them you just press and something immediately
 * happens. Since there is no visual distinction between a ToolButton and an
 * inactive ToggleToolButton, users don't expect that this particular ToolItem
 * is going to behave differently and maintain its state. It's not a huge
 * problem (ie, if the user is paying attention they'll soon find out that the
 * button is a toggle), but it's something that usually takes a few iterations
 * before the user learns. Something to keep in mind.
