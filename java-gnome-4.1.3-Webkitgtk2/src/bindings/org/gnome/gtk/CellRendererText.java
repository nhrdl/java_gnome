 * CellRenderer, used to present Strings. The fundamental mapping method is
 * {@link #setText(DataColumnString) setText()} which you use to indicate the
 * particular DataColumnString from the underlying TreeModel which will
 * provide the Strings.
 *

 * it is desired to apply formatting to that data (converting it to a String
 * in the process) before rendering it. If you do that, you'll probably want
 * to use a second (numerically typed) DataColumn to indicate the appropriate
 * sorting order to be applied if that TreeViewColumn is clicked and sorting
 * is turned on for it; see {@link TreeViewColumn#setSortColumn(DataColumn)
 * setSortColumn()}.
