/**
 * The current state of a Widget with respect to drawing and theming. Within
 * GTK this is used for sub-elements making up a Widget, and different
 * elements may be in different states. In practise, you only use this for
 * rare occasions when you need to override the defaults for example
 * background colour of a Widget. As this will conflict with the Style
 * settings of the users theme and end up creating inconsistencies in visual
 * appearance on the Desktop, methods using StateType should only be used with
 * deliberate care.
