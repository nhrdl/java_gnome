/**
 * The backend to GTK which talks to the actual screen is GDK. There are
 * various classes with the prefix <code>Gdk...</code> which give you access
 * to lower level drawing constructs; these are mapped in java-gnome as the
 * various classes within package <code>org.gnome.gdk</code>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This particular class, on the other hand, simply contains some of the
 * infrastructure necessary to permit multi-threaded access to GDK, GTK, and
 * other GNOME libraries.
 * 
 * <h2>Thread safety in java-gnome</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * None of the other Java graphical toolkits out there let you make GUI calls
 * from threads other than the "main" one; they're all single threaded. Even
 * if all you want to do is a quick worker thread to carry out some input
 * validation in the background after the user presses "OK", you have to jump
 * through horrific contortions to do so safely, resulting in cumbersome,
 * clunky code. By contrast, the java-gnome 4.0 bindings of GTK are
 * <b>transparently thread safe</b>. We integrate properly with the underlying
 * GDK thread lock and as a result you can safely make calls to various GTK
 * methods from worker threads.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>Threading and GNOME is tricky. This class mostly exists for the purpose
 * of holding an object to serve as the global threading monitor and so that
 * when the lock appears in thread dumps it has a useful name.</i>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>Every call made to the native libraries is protected by entering "the
 * master GDK lock"; those familiar with the C side of things would be used to
 * doing this via <code>gdk_threads_enter()</code> and
 * <code>gdk_threads_leave()</code>. When you initialize your java-gnome
 * program with</i> {@link org.gnome.gtk.Gtk#init(String[]) Gtk.init()}<i>,
 * GDK is carefully configured so that the lock used is actually a Java side
 * monitor and therefore reentrant; nested calls all behave properly.</i>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>Note that when in a signal handler callback the GDK lock is already held
 * (you're "in" the main loop when a callback happens), but since it just
 * works transparently you don't need to worry about it. If you do find a need
 * to take the lock into account explicitly in your own code, the object is
 * available here,</i> {@link Gdk#lock Gdk.lock}.
