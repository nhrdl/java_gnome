/**
 * A key value as returned by a keyboard Event. Handling keystrokes is not as
 * much fun as you might think. There is considerable complexity associated
 * with dealing with language and country specific keyboard variants. Most of
 * this complexity is, however, dealt with for you by the X server as proxied
 * by GDK. This class, in turn, provides constants for the basic keyboard set.
 * Various subclasses give you access to localized keyboards.
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is important to note that lower case and upper case letters are
 * considered different keys even though most keyboards present but a single
 * physical button with an <b><code>A</code></b> showing. Think of that
 * physical key as having both an <b><code>a</code></b> and an <b>
 * <code>A</code></b> printed on it, with the second being the key reached if
 * the <b><code>Shift</code></b> modifier is held down. Have a look at the
 * {@link ModifierType} class for a discussion of how to deal with the
 * modifying keys and for a better understanding of the sequence in which key
 * events occur.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Looking for <b><code>1</code></b> through <b><code>9</code></b>? See
 * {@link #Num0 Num0} to {@link #Num0 Num9}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The correlation between keys and Unicode characters is a complex one. For
 * basic western ISO Latin letters the keys we press and the characters we get
 * are, to all intents and purposes, one and the same. But there are many
 * thousands of additional characters for which you probably don't have keys
 * for, even if you have (or have mapped something to be) the <b>
 * <code>Compose</code></b> key for taking the composite of several keystrokes
 * to generate special characters. Just remember that Keyvals are <i>key</i>
 * constants, not constants for every <i>unicode</i> character and you'll keep
 * things straight.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>GDK deals with keyvals exclusively as <code>int</code>s, and there are
 * over 1700 of them. Most of these "keys" are ridiculous or apply to hardware
 * that has long since ceased to exist. We've deliberately constrained this
 * class to a narrow range; experience in 2.x showed that even mighty Eclipse
 * chokes when asked to complete from a list that big. This leads us to two
 * consequences. 1) Constants will be registered for keyvals encountered that
 * haven't been explicitly created here, so you don't have to worry about some
 * nasty RuntimeException kicking your ass. 2) You can extend this Keyval
 * class as necessary to create your own constants if you need to. See</i>
 * {@link KeypadKeyval} <i>for an example.</i>

/*
 * WARNING I've done something in this class that ordinarily would be
 * forbidden, and that is to put raw native values in a bindings class. This
 * is, by definition, a bug and a maintenance nightmare waiting to happen.
 * There are so many constants that merely loading this class would result in
 * hundreds (if not thousands) of JNI calls to populate them.
 * 
 * FIXME So change this to a (define-flags) type behaviour if there are any
 * problems. One idea would be to make it lazy loading, somehow, though
 * perhaps the complexity in that case wouldn't be worth it.
 * 
 * This data for this class was extracted by doing regular expressions on
 * gtk+'s gdk/gdkkeysyms.h; see the script in src/util/keyval/ for details.

     * String.
     * 
     * <p>
     * One way this might be used is:

     * } else if (key == Keyval.Escape) {
     *     // abort
     * } else if (regexAtoZ.matcher(str).matches()) {
     *     entry.setText(str);
     * } else {
     *     ...
     * }
     * </pre>
     * 
     * which is a bit cumbersome, but illustrates one way of identifying
     * "normal" letters being typed.
     * 
     * <p>
     * Not all keys have translations; in such cases <code>0</code> will be
     * returned. Testing for this can sometimes be an easier approach to
     * figuring out if a "normal" key was hit, but your mileage will vary
     * depending on the user's actual configuration. Note that that's
     * <code>(char) 0</code>, not <code>'0'</code>!
     * 
     * <p>
     * <b>Be wary of appending this return value to a String!</b><br>
     * <i>Although Java won't lose the character or subsequent ones,</i>
     * <code>\0</code> <i>is the "<code>NULL</code> terminator" for
     * <code>char*</code> strings in C and will prematurely terminate the
     * printed output if you try to print the String (as, after all, in the
     * final analysis the Java VM is nothing more than a C program and
     * eventually a C library routine will be called to output the text)!</i>
