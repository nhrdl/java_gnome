/**
 * Representation of a physical monitor screen. You can get the Screen object
 * for one of your application's Windows by calling Window's
 * {@link org.gnome.gtk.Window#getScreen() getScreen()} method; it you want
 * the width and height of the screen your Window is on, you're in the right
 * place.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Screen is typically one monitor, but could actually be more; it depends
 * on how your X server is configured. A Display, in turn, is made up of one
 * or more Screens; again it depends.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>With the advent of the</i> <code>XINERAMA</code> <i>extension in the</i>
 * XFree <i>and later</i> X.org <i>X Windows servers, you tend to find that
 * what would have been multiple Screens have been (transparently) merged and
 * stretched to run over an entire multi-headed Display. This works out better
 * (single mouse and keyboard works over the entire desktop, as does cut and
 * paste, dragging, etc) and since the window manager is aware of the
 * situation, it can maximize Windows properly to be only on one physical
 * screen as you'd expect and desire.</i>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>As a result, the distinction between Screen and Display is nowadays
 * somewhat blurred. In practise you can treat them synonymously especially
 * since their methods don't overlap. Frankly, this is all another classic
 * case of "don't second guess the window manager"; just let it do it's job
 * and leave the Window placement alone.</i>
