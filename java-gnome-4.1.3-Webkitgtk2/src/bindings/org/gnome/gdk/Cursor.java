/**
 * That which indicateth where your mouse is pointing!
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Cursor object must be bound to a underlying Window before [changing it]
 * will actually cause what the user sees to change; see
 * {@link Window#setCursor(Cursor) setCursor()} on the Window here in
 * <code>org.gnome.gdk</code>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Quite frequently you want to change the Cursor for the entire application
 * (in a manner reminiscent of modal behaviour). This is trickier than it
 * should be, but you've got a couple possibilities. You can either
 * <ul>
 * <li>maintain a list of all the significant <code>[org.gnome.gtk]</code>
 * Windows being displayed by your application and then call
 * <code>getWindow().setCursor(BLAH)</code> on each of them, or you can
 * <li>use {@link Window#getToplevels() getToplevels()} on
 * <code>[org.gnome.gdk]</code> Window and then similarly just call
 * <code>setCursor(BLAH)</code> as you iterate over the returned set.
 * </ul>
 * The first option is a bit more cumbersome, but many people find themselves
 * maintaining a list of "major" Windows for other purposes, so it can serve.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Almost inevitably the Cursor your want is {@link Cursor#BUSY BUSY} which is
 * the spinning "busy" pointer. You can revert to "normal" by setting
 * {@link Cursor#NORMAL NORMAL} directly (which is the default cursor you
 * spend most of your time looking at), or by passing <code>null</code> to
 * <code>setCursor()</code>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that different theme engines (let alone different Linux vendors) tend
 * to screw with the default pointer icons set quite a bit, so you may find
 * that pointers appear very different for users on different distributions.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>Our implementation of Cursor assumes you want to manipulate
 * <code>GdkCursors</code> on the "default" <code>GdkDisplay</code>. Where
 * else would you be working?</i>
