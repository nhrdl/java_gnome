/**
 * The type of a low-level Event received. Although an {@link Event} is
 * delivered as a parameter of many signals (the "event" signals, in fact), in
 * general you will rarely need to make use of their information.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>WARNING</b> Many of these constants are clearly internal. There's a
 * strong argument to be made that some or all of these should not be publicly
 * visible.
 * 
 * <p>
 * TODO Most of these descriptions are terribly sparse and copied from the
 * underlying documentation. Ordinarily we wouldn't do that, but with any luck
 * you'll not need to be using these classes directly. If anyone has further
 * information on the detailed significance of these constants, <i>please</i>
 * contribute improvements to this class.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>This is principally used to discriminate what kind of concrete Event
 * subclass to create. Note that we are in GDK here; These events refer to the
 * low level constructs delivered to the <code>GdkWindow</code>s that underlie
 * Widgets.</i>
