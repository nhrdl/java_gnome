/**
 * The underlying native resource driving a rectangular region on a screen.
 * These are notable as being what powers the display of Widgets, being both
 * that upon which drawing is done, and that to which user actions are
 * delivered.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In theory, some, but not all, Widgets have their own native windows to draw
 * upon and from whence events originate. Thus Widgets such as Buttons have
 * their own underlying native resource, whereas Labels and various Containers
 * do not. In practise, this distinction is blurred and newer versions of GTK
 * do all sorts of strange things under the hood for greater efficiency. You
 * don't need to worry about any of this.
 * 
 * <p>
 * These are wrappers around Xlib's <code>Window</code> object. They can be
 * arranged in tree structures, wrapping and overlapping one another, with
 * parents cropping children, etc. You don't need to worry about any of this
 * either.
 * 
 * <p>
 * What this <i>is</i> useful for is as a way to get to the state of top level
 * windows and various low level drawing functions.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>Since the C name of this class is <code>GdkWindow</code>, the
 * unavoidable consequence of the java-gnome mapping algorithm is that the
 * name of this class Java is Window. This can be a bit of a pain if you're
 * working in a piece of code where</i> <code>org.gnome.gtk.Window</code>
 * <i>is already imported, but c'est la vie.</i>
