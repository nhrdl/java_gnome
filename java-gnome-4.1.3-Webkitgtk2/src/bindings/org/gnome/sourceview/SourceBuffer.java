/**
 * SourceBuffer is the model used in a {@link SourceView}. It extends GTK's
 * {@link TextBuffer} and adds features typical for text editors. SourceBuffer
 * contains the actual text that is displayed in the view and allows its
 * manipulation.
 * 
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * 
 * The following example shows how a SourceBuffer is created and its initial
 * content is set:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * TextTagTable table;
 * SourceBuffer buffer;
 * ...
 * 
 * table = new TextTagTable();
 * buffer = new SourceBuffer();
 * buffer.setText(&quot;Insert text here...&quot;);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The language used for syntax highlighting has to be obtained from the
 * LanguageManager:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * manager = LanguageManager.getDefault();
 * language = manager.getLanguage(&quot;java&quot;);
 * buffer.setLanguage(language);
 * </pre>
