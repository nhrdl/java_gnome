/**
 * Take screenshots. This class is explicitly here to support taking the
 * screenshots used as illustrations in the java-gnome API documentation.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Usage is simple: given a Window, {@link org.gnome.gtk.Window#present()
 * present()} it, and then call the <code>capture</code> method here.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * final Window window;
 * final Pixbuf result;
 * 
 * window.present();
 * result = Screenshot.capture();
 * result.save(...);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that for some reason taking screenshots is a very slow and CPU
 * intensive process. Unfortunately, it occurs within the GDK lock and thus
 * <i>will</i> block your UI for a few seconds. Threading can't help you
 * parallelize this.
