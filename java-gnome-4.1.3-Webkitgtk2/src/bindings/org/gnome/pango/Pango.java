    /*
     * The Pango library uses a fixed point system, scaled up by this
     * constant; Cairo on the other hand uses doubles. Since all the drawing
     * we're doing with Pango will be in the context of a Cairo drawing
     * operation, we expose our API as doubles to match Cairo, and quietly
     * convert internally.
     * 
     * Seeing as how Pango draws on Cairo, it'd be nice if Pango just exposed
     * the doubles and was done with it.
     * 
     * Since we divide by this frequently, we keep it here as a double to
     * reduce the risk of creating divide-by-integer errors.
     * 
     * FUTURE retreive from native as this is subject to change in the future.
