 * Constants use to scale text by an amount relative to that around it. This

 * The default, such as it is, is {@link #NORMAL NORMAL} which represents a
 * scaling factor of <code>1.0</code>, (ie. no scaling).
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>In case you're wondering, these scaling constants are</i>

 * <code>1,2,3</code> for</i> {@link #LARGE LARGE}, {@link #X_LARGE X_LARGE},
 * {@link #XX_LARGE XX_LARGE}<i>, and <code>-1,-2,-3</code> for</i>
 * {@link #SMALL SMALL}, {@link #X_SMALL X_SMALL}, <i>and</i>

 * be suggested, write an Override class to access these constants.
