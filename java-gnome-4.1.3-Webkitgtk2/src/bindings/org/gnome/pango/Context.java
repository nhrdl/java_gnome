 * <p>
 * This is one of those cases where we are unfortunate that the class name
 * collides with the same name from another package and you could find
 * yourself using both in the same file. If you're working from a Layout and
 * need to use this, and given theses:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * import org.freedesktop.cairo.Context;
 * import org.freedesktop.cairo.FontOptions;
 * import org.gnome.pango.Layout;
 * import org.gnome.gtk.Widget;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * etc, you might be well off to do something like this in a
 * <code>Widget.Draw</code> signal handler:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * final Layout layout;
 * final FontOptions config;
 * 
 * layout = new Layout(cr);
 * config = new FontOptions();
 * ...
 * 
 * layout.getContext().setFontOptions(config);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * which avoids you having to use the fully qualified
 * <code>org.gnome.pango.Context</code> name when you call Layout's
 * <code>getContext()</code>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>You ordinarily do not need to use this, although you might want to know
 * that every time a Pango Layout is created a fresh Pango Context is done
 * up.</i>
