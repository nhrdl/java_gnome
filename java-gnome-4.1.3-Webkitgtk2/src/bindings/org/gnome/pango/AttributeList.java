/**
 * A list of Attributes that will be applied to a piece of text.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Used as follows. First, build your text up into a String and initialize the
 * Layout with it. You'll also have to create the wrapper that will hold the
 * list of Attributes that will be applied to that Layout.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * layout = new Layout(cr);
 * layout.setText(str);
 * 
 * list = new AttributeList();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Then, iterate over your text and for each span where you want formatting,
 * create one or more Attributes and specify the ranges that each will apply.
 * For instance, for a word starting at offset <code>15</code> and being
 * <code>4</code> characters wide.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * attr = new StyleAttribute(Style.ITALIC);
 * attr.setIndexes(15, 4);
 * list.insert(attr);
 * 
 * attr = new ForegroundColorAttribute(0.1, 0.5, 0.9);
 * attr.setIndexes(15, 4);
 * list.insert(attr);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * etc, adding each one to the AttributeList. Finally, tell the Layout to use
 * that list:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * layout.setAttributes(list);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * and you're on your way.
