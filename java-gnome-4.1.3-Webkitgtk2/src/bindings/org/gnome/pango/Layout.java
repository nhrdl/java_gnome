/**
 * A Layout represents a paragraph of text, together with its attributes.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Drawing is done with Cairo; you get a Layout by passing the Cairo drawing
 * Context you're currently working in to the constructor. If you're drawing a
 * Widget, you'll be doing so in a <code>Widget.Draw</code> signal handler
 * where you'll typically see:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * w.connect(new Widget.Draw() {
 *     public boolean onDraw(Widget source, Context cr) {
 *         final Layout layout;
 * 
 *         layout = new Layout(cr);
 * 
 *         // use layout to lay out the text you wish to draw
 * 
 *         cr.showLayout(layout);
 *     }
 * });
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Layout can indeed layout multiple paragraphs of text, but usually you need
 * more control over positioning, so most of the time you have to work a
 * paragraph at a time. You can, however, avoid creating a new Layout each
 * time by calling {@link #setText(String) setText()} with the new paragraph
 * text.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>A single paragraph at a time is how PangoLayout was designed and
 * intended to be used.</i>
