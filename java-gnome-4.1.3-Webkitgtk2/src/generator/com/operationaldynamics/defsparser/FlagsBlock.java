/**
 * Block object representing the .defs data defining a Flag. A flag is like an
 * enum, but their ordinal values can't be obtained in an automatic way.
 * 
 * Source .defs data for an emum is of the following form:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  (define-flags WindowState
 *    (in-module &quot;Gdk&quot;)
 *    (c-name &quot;GdkWindowState&quot;)
 *    (gtype-id &quot;GDK_TYPE_WINDOW_STATE&quot;)
 *    (values
 *      '(&quot;withdrawn&quot; &quot;GDK_WINDOW_STATE_WITHDRAWN&quot;)
 *      '(&quot;iconified&quot; &quot;GDK_WINDOW_STATE_ICONIFIED&quot;)
 *    )
 *  )
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Like Enums, all the information needed to define the Java code that will
 * result for a Flag type is in a single (define...) stanza.
