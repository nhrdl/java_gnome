/**
 * A .defs block that gives the information for a method on a GObject.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Source .defs data is of the following form:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  (define-method set_label
 *    (of-object &quot;GtkButton&quot;)
 *    (c-name &quot;gtk_button_set_label&quot;)
 *    (return-type &quot;none&quot;)
 *    (parameters
 *      '(&quot;const-gchar*&quot; &quot;label&quot;)
 *    )
 *  )
 * </pre>
 * 
 * In a sense, the definition of a method in GNOME terms is a function whose
 * first parameter is a pointer to the object that the function will act on.
 * This is implicit in the .defs data so we prepend a reference to self to the
 * parameter list as we construct the object to represent this block.
