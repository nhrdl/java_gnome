 * Types that are blacklisted. This could be hard coded for either code
 * generator or java-gnome architectural reasons, but in all likelihood it is
 * because we haven't the faintest idea what this type is yet due to lacking
 * defs data or lacking Fundamental declarations. Note that this will be
 * mapped as {@link org.freedesktop.bindings.FIXME} which is about as clear an
 * indication as you could ask for that it's foobarred.
