         * forms of setValue() to store data in that row.
         * 
         * In practise, however, you will find the setting of data to be
         * fairly involved; after all, it takes some trouble to decide what
         * you want to display, extract if from your domain object layer and
         * format it prior to insertion into the TreeModel for display by a
         * TreeView.
         * 
         * Notice the use of Pango markup in the placeName column. This can be
         * a powerful way of improving your information density, but be aware
         * that if some rows have multiple lines and some don't, the row
         * height will be inconsistent and will look really ugly. So make sure
         * they all have the same font information and number of newlines. You
         * would use utility methods to help keep things organized, of course,
         * but we've kept it straight forward here.
