/**
 * An example of rendering multi-line text in an application.
 * 
 * There comes a point when it is difficult to demonstrate complex
 * functionality in a trivial example, so so illustrate usage of the powerful
 * TextView/TextBuffer APIs, we so we have opted to do something a bit more
 * involved.
 * 
 * This program creates the conversation window you might see in a typical
 * graphical instant messenger. It has a TextView displaying the conversation
 * above, and uses various formatting to differentiate between incoming
 * messages and outgoing ones. There is a second TextView at the bottom where
 * the user can write the messages and "send" them. Finally, a tiny worker
 * thread is kicked off to simulate incoming conversation.
 * 
 * Enjoy!
