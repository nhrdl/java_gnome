         * 'clicked' signal. This is how we do it in java-gnome.
         * 
         * Button.Clicked is a Java interface. You create an instance of it to
         * do what you want when the callback happens, and then pass it to the
         * Button's connect() method.
         * 
         * The onClicked() method is what is required by the Button.Clicked
         * interface. Most IDEs will prompt you asking if you want to "Add
         * unimplemented methods?" You bet! And ta-da! You have exactly the
         * signature you need to implement a 'clicked' signal handler.
         * 
         * Since we declared b as final we can use it in the anonymous nested
         * class (yet another reason that final is worth using). If the
         * situation were otherwise, then the source parameter can be used to
         * find out what Button was clicked.
