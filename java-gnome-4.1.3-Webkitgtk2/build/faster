# faster.py, an abbreviated build script for java-gnome
# Must be invoked from the project top level directory as [./]build/faster
#

#
# This is a total hack, but a good one :) Make has two critical weakness, which
# this script, being programmatic, tries to address:
#
# 1) variables are only populated once, so the variables containing the lists
# of files to be built resulting from output of the code generator are
# inaccurate (or in a clean build, empty)
#
# 2) it doesn't look at actual file contents, only looking to see if the target
# is older than the source file(s). This is a real problem for people hacking
# on the bindings; every time you save a source file in the generator, it runs,
# and even though most (even all) of output files are unchanged [ie, were
# refilled with exactly the same content], they are newer, and so make charges
# ahead with a full rebuild, costing over 5 minutes of CPU time.
#
# So this program takes an md5sum of each source file at each step, only
# invoking the external program for that target if the files have actually
# changed since the last run.
#
# No, this is not some grand replacement for all the worlds problems. It's a
# quick hack. I said so already. And it's entirely custom for building
# java-gnome. But it encapsulates some of the capabilities that buildtool will
# bring to the process when it lands, so it is a step in the right direction.
